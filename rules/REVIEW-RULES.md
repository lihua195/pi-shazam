# REVIEW-RULES.md for pi-shazam

You are reviewing **pi-shazam**, a Pi coding agent native codebase awareness toolkit that unifies tree-sitter parsing, LSP protocol communication, and PageRank-based dependency analysis into a set of agent-callable tools. This guide focuses your review on real bugs and reliability issues only.

## Project Context

- **What it is**: TypeScript/Node.js Pi extension providing 7 structural analysis tools (overview, lookup, impact, verify, changes, format, rename_symbol) plus 11 lifecycle hooks, and a standalone MCP server exposing the same 7 tools via stdio JSON-RPC.
- **Size**: 48 TypeScript source files across 5 directories (core/, tools/, hooks/, lsp/, mcp/) + 50+ vitest test files. Approaching the "Mature" stage.
- **Runtime**: Node.js >= 18, ESM modules, runs as a Pi extension loaded into the Pi coding agent process.
- **Dependencies**: tree-sitter (multi-language parsing), vscode-jsonrpc + vscode-languageserver-protocol (LSP JSON-RPC), iconv-lite (UTF-8/GBK encoding fallback), @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (MCP server), typebox (tool parameter schemas), zod (MCP validation).
- **Key architecture facts**:
  - Strict 4-layer dependency: `hooks/` → `tools/` → `core/` + `lsp/`. `core/` has zero Pi or LSP imports. Layer violations are not caught by tsc; manual verification required. `mcp/` is a standalone entry point that may import from `tools/`, `core/`, and `lsp/` but must NOT import from `hooks/` (except for pure stateless utility modules -- if a hooks module must be shared, it belongs in `tools/` or `core/`).
  - Module-level mutable state: `cachedGraph`, `_projectRootOverride`, `_scanning` mutex, `_rpcModule`, `_notifications`. All are reset on `session_shutdown`. Concurrent access is guarded by a re-entrancy mutex (`_scanning` flag), not async locks.
  - Tools register via a factory (`tools/_factory.ts`) that auto-injects `json`/`maxTokens` params, scans the project graph, and wraps output in a standardized envelope. Tools with complex async LSP logic use `customExecute` which bypasses auto-scan.
  - MCP server uses `tools/definitions.ts` as single source of truth (SSOT) for tool names, descriptions, and Zod schemas. MCP handlers wrap tool executors with `withLogging` for audit logging and must apply `validatePathInProject` to every user-supplied file path.

## Review Rules

### DO report these (P0 -- must fix)

1. **Layer boundary violations**: A `core/` file importing from `tools/`, `hooks/`, or `lsp/`; a `lsp/` file importing from `tools/` or `hooks/`; a `tools/` file importing from `hooks/`.
2. **Type safety holes**: `as` casts that suppress type errors, `any` usage that bypasses the graph data model, missing null checks on `Map.get()` results where the key may not exist.
3. **Stale graph state bugs**: Code paths that mutate `RepoGraph` maps without updating all related indexes (`nameIndex`, `targetToSources`, `incoming`, `outgoing`). Also: code that reads `cachedGraph` after a scan failure without checking for null. File-level reference maps (`fileCalls`, `fileRefs`, `fileTypeRefs`, `fileImports`, `fileImportBindings`) must be cleared in `removeEdgesForFile` / `removeFileData` alongside edge indexes to prevent phantom edges after incremental scan.
4. **Re-entrancy / concurrency hazards**: Calls to `scanProject()` inside a tool execute path that could be re-entered (the `_scanning` mutex throws on re-entry, but the throw may be swallowed). Async operations on `cachedGraph` without the mutex held.
5. **Resource leaks**: LSP child processes not shut down on `session_shutdown`, timer handles not cleared (e.g., `setTimeout` in `withTimeout`), event listeners not removed on `AbortSignal`.
6. **Path traversal / security**: Input file paths not validated against project root (use `validatePathInProject` from `_factory.ts`). Symlink escapes not caught by `realpathSync` check. Commands injected via tool parameters that reach `execSync` or `spawn`.
7. **Data corruption on graph serialization**: `deserializeGraphV2` missing null-guards on cache fields (validated in `data-integrity.test.ts`). Edge deduplication not applied during deserialization. NameIndex not rebuilt after deserialization.
8. **Empty catch blocks**: Any `catch` that silently swallows an error without logging via `_logWarn` or propagating. Especially in LSP request methods, scanner file reads, and hook event handlers.
9. **Encoding boundary bugs**: UTF-8 detection failing when a multi-byte character straddles the 64KB validation chunk boundary (tested in `encoding-boundary.test.ts`). GBK/GB2312 fallback returning garbled text for valid UTF-8 files.
10. **MAX_FILES truncation without warning**: `collectSourceFiles` sets `truncated=true` but if the caller ignores it, the graph is silently incomplete (fixed in #471-A, regression check).
11. **MCP path traversal in file parameters**: Every MCP tool handler that accepts a `file`/`files`/`name` (when detected as a file path) parameter MUST call `validatePathInProject(param, projectRoot)` before accessing the filesystem. Missing validation allows reading/writing files outside PROJECT_ROOT (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`). Also applies to `shazam_format --file` which performs writes.
12. **MCP isMainModule detection failure**: The symlink-resolved `isMainModule` check in `mcp/entry.ts` must correctly identify when the module is the entry point. If it returns false when launched via `npx pi-shazam-mcp`, the server never starts (regression guard for #485).

### DO report these (P1 -- reliability risk)

1. **Missing error handling in LSP request methods**: `definition`, `references`, `hover`, etc. return `LspResult` but callers may not check `status === "error"` before accessing `.data`.
2. **Silent failures**: `parseFile` in scanner catches errors and returns null -- if the error is not `FileTooLargeError`, the file is silently skipped. Missing symbols may cascade into incorrect impact analysis.
3. **Inconsistent project root**: `process.cwd()` vs `getEffectiveRoot()` vs `_projectRootOverride`. Code that uses `process.cwd()` directly instead of `getEffectiveRoot()` will break when Pi is launched from a parent directory.
4. **Tool description drift**: Pi tool descriptions in `tools/*.ts` not matching MCP tool descriptions in `mcp/tools.ts`. Also: tool descriptions that suggest parameters or behavior the tool does not support.
5. **Notification cap eviction correctness**: `_notifications` Map in `LspClient` is capped at 2000 entries with oldest-first eviction. Eviction preserves insertion order but may drop diagnostics for files that were opened early and never re-saved during a long session.
6. **Token budget truncation**: `truncateOutput` uses 4 chars/token heuristic. If a tool's output contains dense CJK text or very long lines, the heuristic may underestimate and exceed the Pi runtime's actual token budget.
7. **Edge cases in incremental scan**: `scanIncremental` builds `dependentFiles` from `findDependentFiles` but also adds cross-file call edges via `oldIncomingBySymId` snapshot. If the snapshot is stale (graph mutated between snapshot and rebuild), dependent files may be missed.
8. **Pi-MCP schema drift**: `typeboxParams` in `tools/definitions.ts` must include all parameters that exist in `zodParams` (except MCP-specific `maxTokens`/`json` which are auto-injected by the Pi factory). If a parameter exists in zodParams but not typeboxParams, it becomes inaccessible in Pi mode. Conversely, required Pi parameters that are missing from zodParams will cause MCP calls to fail validation.
9. **MCP unsafe type casts**: MCP handlers receive `Record<string, unknown>` from the MCP SDK and cast directly (`as string`, `as boolean`, `as number`, `as string[]`). Zod schemas should validate these at the SDK boundary, but verify the cast types match zod schema types exactly -- a `z.number()` cast as `string` will cause runtime failures.
10. **MCP error response inconsistency**: Some MCP handlers return `{ content: [...], isError: true }` for parameter validation errors, while others `throw` which the SDK converts to a JSON-RPC error. Verify error handling is consistent and user-facing error messages do not leak stack traces or absolute paths.
11. **MCP LSP lifecycle on init failure**: When `lspManager.initializeAll()` throws in `mcp/entry.ts`, the server continues without LSP (graceful degradation). Verify that `setLspManager` receives either a working manager or null, and tools do not crash when LSP is unavailable (tree-sitter-only fallback).
12. **MCP concurrent getGraph calls**: `getGraph()` calls `scanProject()` on every MCP tool invocation without a mutex. Concurrent MCP requests may trigger overlapping scans. `scanProject` has its own `_scanning` guard which throws on re-entry -- verify the throw is caught by `withLogging` and does not crash the MCP transport.
13. **MCP layer violation**: `mcp/tools.ts` must not import from `hooks/`. Currently imports `hasCallChainChecked`/`recordCallChain` from `hooks/rename-state.ts` (a known layering issue -- the module is stateless and should be relocated to `tools/`). Report any new hooks imports added to `mcp/`.

### DO NOT report these (ignore -- not useful)

- Code style, formatting, variable naming, line length, JSDoc completeness.
- Rename suggestions, function-split suggestions -- unless there is a concrete bug caused by the structure.
- Test coverage percentages, missing test categories.
- Dependency version suggestions (unless there is a known CVE).
- Linting-level suggestions (`const` vs `let`, `===` vs `==`).
- TypeScript strictness flags.
- Missing docs, missing comments -- the project manages docs separately.
- Architecture opinions ("use class instead of interface").
- Feature suggestions not currently implemented.

| `core/scanner.ts`      | `scanProject` / `scanIncremental` / `scanFull`: stale index bugs in `removeFileData` and `removeEdgesForFile` (4 index maps + 5 file-level maps must stay consistent: `fileCalls`, `fileRefs`, `fileTypeRefs`, `fileImports`, `fileImportBindings`). `findDependentFiles` reverse index correctness. `_projectRootOverride` not propagated to all scan paths. `_scanning` mutex not reset on exception (the `finally` block should handle it -- verify). Edge kinds: import (0.3/0.5), call (1.0/0.9), ref (0.5/0.9), type (0.4/0.8), import-binding (0.8/1.0). |
| `core/graph.ts`        | `deserializeGraphV2`: null-guard on every cache field; dangling edge skip with `_logWarn`. `compareGraphSnapshots`: edge identity includes weight/confidence; stable-key reconciliation correctness. `nameIndex` rebuild after deserialization must match `scanFull` behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `lsp/client.ts`        | `withTimeout`: timer cleanup in all paths (resolve, reject, cancel). `_sendRequest`: `CancellationTokenSource` disposed in finally; external token listener removed. `_notifications` cap eviction: oldest-first is correct but verify it does not evict the most recently updated entry. `_cleanupAfterCrash` idempotency (the `_cleanedUp` latch).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `tools/_factory.ts`    | `validatePathInProject`: `realpathSync` is called but the resolved real path is not returned -- callers must re-resolve. `createTool`: error path in `execute` callback -- when `domainFn` throws and `json=false`, the error is returned as `isError: true` but not logged via `_logWarn`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `tools/definitions.ts` | SSOT for tool names, descriptions, typeboxParams (Pi), and zodParams (MCP). Every parameter in zodParams must have a corresponding typeboxParams entry (except `maxTokens`/`json` auto-injected by Pi factory). Required params in one schema must be required in the other. Tool names must use `shazam_` prefix consistently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `mcp/entry.ts`         | `validateProjectRoot`: home-only check is opt-in via `PI_SHAZAM_HOME_ONLY`; default must accept any valid directory (#465). `isMainModule`: symlink resolution must work for both `dist/mcp/entry.js` (compiled) and source-level vitest runs (#485). Version detection: package.json search must check both `../..` and `..` paths. LSP init failure must not prevent server startup (graceful degradation). Shutdown: `_shuttingDown` latch must prevent double-LSP-shutdown across SIGINT/SIGTERM/transport.onclose/stdin('end').                            |

### Tier 2 -- State & Recovery

| `core/cache.ts`   | `saveGraphCache`: serialization must be atomic (no partial writes). `loadGraphCache`: corrupted JSON must not crash -- the try/catch around `JSON.parse` should catch all parse errors. Version mismatch handling (currently only v2 supported).                                                            |
| `lsp/manager.ts`  | `initializeAll`: timeout guard via `Promise.race` -- verify cleanup on timeout (orphaned processes). `shutdown`: all clients shut down in parallel; verify no unhandled rejection if one client fails. `detectLanguages`: file walk uses `readdirSync` -- verify skip-dir logic for `node_modules`, `.git`. |
| `hooks/safety.ts` | Destructive command patterns: regex coverage for bypass variants (extra spaces, tabs, split flags). `tokenizeSegments`: chained command parsing (e.g., `echo safe && git commit`). Pre-commit gate: `hasRecentPassingVerify` timer -- verify the 5-minute window is not too short/long.                     |
| `core/output.ts`  | `_logWarn`: ENOENT suppression is correct but verify other expected error codes (EACCES, EPERM) are NOT suppressed. `truncateOutput`: high-priority line detection by prefix -- verify important detail lines starting with `- ` are not dropped.                                                           |

Rename safety gate (`hasCallChainChecked`) must be enforced for non-dry-run renames. Audit log writes must be fire-and-forget (never block the handler). |

- [ ] `npm run build` produces `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.d.ts`
- [ ] `npm test` -- all tests pass, 0 failures
- [ ] `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" core/ tools/ hooks/ lsp/ mcp/ --include="*.ts"` -- any leftover markers?
- [ ] `grep -r "console\.\(log\|error\)" core/ tools/ hooks/ lsp/ mcp/ --include="*.ts"` -- are there debug logs that should use `_logWarn`? (Exclude `_logWarn`'s own `console.warn` and entry.ts `console.error` for startup errors)
- [ ] `grep -rn "as " core/ lsp/ mcp/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v "as const\|as string\|as number\|as never\|as unknown\|as boolean"` -- any unsafe type casts?
- [ ] Verify no `core/` file imports from `tools/`, `hooks/`, or `lsp/`: `grep -rn "from '\.\.\/tools\|from '\.\.\/hooks\|from '\.\.\/lsp" core/ --include="*.ts"`
- [ ] Verify no `mcp/` file imports from `hooks/`: `grep -rn "from.*hooks" mcp/ --include="*.ts"` (currently only `rename-state.ts` -- a known issue to relocate)
- [ ] Verify no empty catch blocks: `grep -rn "catch\s*{" core/ tools/ hooks/ lsp/ mcp/ --include="*.ts"` (empty catch with no body/log)
- [ ] `grep -rn "process\.cwd()" tools/ hooks/ mcp/ --include="*.ts"` -- should use `getEffectiveRoot()` (Pi) or `projectRoot` parameter (MCP) instead
- [ ] Verify MCP tools count matches Pi tools: `grep -c "server\.registerTool" mcp/tools.ts` equals 7 (one per tool in TOOL_DEFINITIONS)
- [ ] Verify all MCP file params use validatePathInProject: `grep -c "validatePathInProject" mcp/tools.ts` must be >= 4 (lookup name-as-path + lookup file param + impact files loop + format file), and verify no new file-accepting tool was added without calling it
- [ ] Verify typebox/zod param parity: for each tool in `tools/definitions.ts`, every required param in typeboxParams must exist in zodParams and vice versa (except `maxTokens`/`json` which are auto-injected by Pi factory and MCP-only)
- [ ] Run `npm audit --omit=dev` -- any known vulnerabilities in runtime dependencies?
