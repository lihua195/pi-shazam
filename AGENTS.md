## User System Rules

# Rules

## 1) Prohibitions

- No silent assumptions at critical semantic points.
- No fabricated tool outputs, test results, logs, or external confirmations.
- No hardcoding where constants, enums, or shared definitions are appropriate.
- No blind copy-paste of generated code. Review all generated code, especially queries, auth, file handling, and user input.
- No skipping verification for features, bugfixes, or behavior changes.
- No ignoring security on auth, permissions, secrets, file access, execution, or user input paths.

## 2) Basic Norms

- Address the user as `老板`.
- Default to Simplified Chinese. Use English only for code, commands, technical terms, commit types, and tool names.
- Treat the user as non-technical unless they clearly ask for engineering detail. Explain in business terms first.
- Do not dump code unless the user asks for code.
- Verify important claims with tools. Do not ignore type errors, build errors, failing tests, or command failures.
- Comments added to code must explain: business purpose, implementation logic, and edge cases; use Chinese and avoid jargon.

## 3) Behavioral Guidelines

### 3.1 Before Acting

- State assumptions explicitly when meaning is unclear.
- Propose a simpler path when the requested approach is heavier than necessary.
- When business logic or domain rules are unclear, ask once rather than guess. A wrong assumption costs more than a clarifying question.

### 3.2 Change Discipline

- Do only what the user asked. Prefer the smallest change that solves the request.
- Fix broken things on sight — build errors, missing dependencies, type errors, broken commands — regardless of whether the current task introduced it. Do not touch anything that is a matter of style or opinion (naming, formatting, architecture preference) unless the task explicitly requires it. Report fixes in the completion report.
- Match the local style of the touched area.
- Keep shared business rules, cache keys, and classification logic in one source of truth. When adding state, cache, schema, or persisted fields, update the full lifecycle.

### 3.3 Verifiable Execution

- Verify beyond the happy path: boundary cases, repeated runs, and nearby old entry points.
- Execute autonomously. Do not stop and ask for confirmation between steps — keep going until the task is complete or you hit a blocker.
- Stop and ask only when: (a) verification fails and you cannot fix it, (b) business meaning or domain rules are unclear, (c) a destructive action has no safety net, or (d) the user explicitly asked to be consulted.
- Verification failure: stop immediately, report what failed and why, do not self-patch tests or silently work around the failure.
- If the request is naturally multi-step, list the plan first, then execute all steps autonomously:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

## 4) Completion Report

Trigger only when the task or milestone is fully completed:

```markdown
老板您好，已完成 [一句话总结]。

**做了什么**

- [业务层面]: [通俗说明变更内容和原因]

**结果**

- [什么变了]: [用户视角描述变更效果]
- [影响范围]: [受影响的页面/功能/模块]

**已确认**

- [验证项 1]: [验证方式和结果]
- [验证项 2]: [验证方式和结果]

**需要你决策**

- [需人工判断的事项]: [为什么需要你决定]

**待跟进**

- #N: [简述] → 已建 issue，后续处理
```

## 5) Tool Invocation — Aggressive & Automatic

Skills and MCP tools provide domain-specific knowledge and workflows. When a relevant skill or MCP tool exists for the task at hand, invoke it without asking — do not default to raw shell commands when a better alternative is available.

## 6) Coding Structure Rules

### 6.1 Function Scope

- A function does ONE thing. If its name needs "and" to describe its purpose, split it.
- If a function exceeds 80 lines, extract helper functions (`_build_*`, `_compute_*`, `_classify_*`).

### 6.2 File Boundaries

- One file = one business concept. A file named `utils.py` or `helpers.ts` over 200 lines is no longer utilities — split it by domain.
- When a single file contains 2+ unrelated domains, extract each into its own file under a shared directory.
- When migrating: grep all callers first, update them, then delete the old file. Do not create pass-through compatibility layers.

### 6.3 Deletion Discipline

- When a component, function, or module is replaced, delete the old one in the same change. No compatibility wrappers.
- Before deleting, grep for all references. If any remain, update them in the same change.
- A file that only re-exports another module's symbols is dead weight — inline the imports at call sites and remove the file.

### 6.4 API Calls

- Before writing any `fetch()`, `axios.`, `curl`, or API client code, read `./api.d.ts` if it exists. The endpoint path, HTTP method, request shape, and response shape must match `api.d.ts` exactly.
- When implementing a new API call, cross-check: does the backend endpoint exist in `api.d.ts`? Does the frontend request shape match the backend's expected input?
- External library APIs → query `context7` MCP. Your project's own API → read `./api.d.ts`. Know which is which — do not guess either.
- If the needed endpoint is not in `api.d.ts`, update `api.d.ts` FIRST, then implement both backend and frontend. Never write client code against an undocumented endpoint.

### 6.5 Logging

- Every `except` / `catch` / `match Err` branch must either handle the error (with a log) or propagate it. Empty catch blocks are forbidden.
- When handling an error, log: what operation failed, the input context, and the original error message.

## 7) Reasoning

Reasoning effort is set to xhigh. Please think carefully through the task, validate key assumptions, consider plausible alternatives, and prioritize correctness, consistency, and clarity in the final answer.

## 8) Toolchain Rules

- Python: ALL operations MUST go through `uv` — installing, running, syncing, building. NEVER invoke `python`, `pip`, `venv`, or `virtualenv` directly. If a command needs Python, wrap it with `uv run`. If dependencies need installing, use `uv sync`. If a virtual environment is needed, `uv` manages it automatically.

## 9) Open Source Issue Reply Guidelines

pi-shazam is an open-source project. When replying to issues filed by external (non-owner) users:

- **Tone**: Warm, appreciative, and welcoming. This is someone giving us free time and feedback — treat them as a valued contributor, not a ticket number.
- **Language**: Reply in English (open-source convention). Use the user's name or GitHub handle.
- **Structure**: Acknowledge the issue → state what was done → mention the fix version → thank them.
- **For bug reports**: Thank them for finding it, confirm the root cause briefly, link the fixing PR, mention the version it will ship in.
- **For feature requests**: Thank them for the idea, explain whether/how it will be implemented, mention any known limitations (e.g., dependency constraints).
- **Never**: Be dismissive, blame the user, leave an issue unacknowledged for more than 48 hours, or close without explanation.
- **Template for bug fix**:

  ```
  Hi @{user}, thank you for reporting this!

  Root cause: [brief explanation]

  Fixed in PR #{pr_number}, shipped in v{version}.
  Please upgrade: `pi install npm:pi-shazam@latest`

  Feel free to reopen if you still see the issue after updating.
  ```

- **Template for feature request**:

  ```
  Hi @{user}, great suggestion!

  Implemented in PR #{pr_number}, shipping in v{version}.

  Known limitation: [if any, explain briefly]
  Full support will be available when [condition, e.g., dependency upgrades].

  Thanks for helping us improve!
  ```

# pi-shazam

Pi coding agent native codebase awareness extension. "Shazam" — like the superhero whose power comes from multiple deities, pi-shazam unifies the strength of multiple analysis engines (repomap/aider, pi-lens, serena MCP, tree-sitter, LSP) into one coherent interface for the agent.

Rewrites the Python CLI project [repomap](https://github.com/gjczone/repomap) as a native Pi extension in TypeScript. All analysis capabilities register as first-class Pi tools — LLM sees them alongside `read`/`write`/`bash` with no distinction.

## Project Snapshot

- **Runtime**: TypeScript on Node.js ≥18, ES2022 target, NodeNext module resolution, ESM (`"type": "module"`)
- **Package**: npm `pi-shazam` (v0.15.2), entry `dist/index.js` (default export function receiving `ExtensionAPI`)
- **Primary user flow**: LLM calls analysis tools (`overview`, `lookup`, `impact`, etc.) to understand code structure, change impact, and call chains before making edits
- **Architecture**: 4 layers — `core/` (parsing, graph, ranking), `lsp/` (language server management), `tools/` (Pi tool wrappers), `hooks/` (automatic verification)
- **External dependency**: Language servers (pyright, tsserver, rust-analyzer, gopls) are user-installed; pi-shazam manages process lifecycle
- **Release artifact**: npm package with `dist/` compiled output
- **Risk areas**: LSP process lifecycle edge cases, tree-sitter grammar binary compatibility across platforms, encoding fallback for non-UTF-8 source files

| `npm publish`                    | **DO NOT use directly** — Publishing is done via GitHub Actions (see Release & Publish workflow) |

## Development Environment

- Node.js ≥18, npm as package manager
- `types/pi-extension.d.ts` provides self-contained `ExtensionAPI` type stub (extracted from Pi coding agent runtime at `~/.pi/`, scope `@earendil-works/pi-*`)
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` required due to tree-sitter grammar peer dependency conflicts
- `tree-sitter@^0.22.4` pinned via `overrides` in package.json
- `vscode-languageserver-protocol` for LSP type definitions
- `iconv-lite` for UTF-8/GBK/GB2312 encoding fallback
- Test the extension by symlinking `dist/` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-shazam` or configuring in Pi settings

## Dependency API Reference (context7 verified 2026-06)

### tree-sitter (node-tree-sitter v0.22.4)

- **Parser**: `import Parser from "tree-sitter"` → `new Parser()` → `parser.setLanguage(new Language(grammarModule))`
- **Parsing**: `parser.parse(sourceString)` returns `Tree`; `tree.rootNode` for root `SyntaxNode`
- **Query**: `new Query(language, queryString)` → `query.captures(node)` returns `{name: string, node: SyntaxNode}[]`
- **No QueryCursor**: Node.js binding does not have Python's `QueryCursor` class, use `query.captures()` directly
- **Node properties**: `node.type`, `node.text`, `node.children`, `node.parent`, `node.previousSibling`, `node.startPosition`/`endPosition` (`.row`/`.column`), `node.childForFieldName("name")`
- **Grammar loading**: `new Language(grammarModule)` wraps native module, not Python's `Language(fn())` constructor pattern
- **Input type**: `parse()` accepts `string` or callback `(index, position) => string | null`, not Buffer
- **No built-in .d.ts**: Need to declare types manually or use `@types/tree-sitter`

### vscode-languageserver-protocol (v3.18.0) + vscode-jsonrpc (v9.0.0)

- **Protocol types**: Import `Diagnostic`, `Location`, `Position`, `Range`, `SymbolKind`, `InitializeParams`, `InitializeResult`, `TextDocumentItem`, `DidOpenTextDocumentParams`, `ReferenceContext` etc. from `vscode-languageserver-protocol`
- **LSP client communication**: Use `vscode-jsonrpc/node`'s `StreamMessageReader` / `StreamMessageWriter` + `createMessageConnection` instead of hand-written Content-Length frame parsing. This is the officially recommended client pattern, and `vscode-jsonrpc@9.0.0` is already a transitive dependency
- **Usage example**: `import * as rpc from "vscode-jsonrpc/node"` → `rpc.createMessageConnection(new rpc.StreamMessageReader(child.stdout), new rpc.StreamMessageWriter(child.stdin))` → `connection.sendRequest(method, params)` / `connection.onNotification(type, handler)`
- **Do not use createConnection**: `createConnection` is a server-side API (for building language servers), this project is a client and does not need it

### Layer dependency direction

`hooks/` → `tools/` → `core/` + `lsp/`. The `core/` layer has zero Pi or LSP imports. Tools compose core functions and optionally enrich with LSP data. Hooks call tool logic directly and inject results into LLM context via `pi.sendMessage()`.

## Hooks (Automatic Event Handlers)

| Hook                  | Event                                    | Auto? | Effect                                                                  | Value                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `before-start`        | `before_agent_start`                     | YES   | Injects project overview + proactive recommendations into system prompt | HIGH — LLM has structural awareness before reading code |
| `safety`              | `tool_call` (bash)                       | YES   | Destructive command confirmation + pre-commit gate                      | HIGH — prevents data loss and unverified commits        |
| `pre-edit`            | `tool_call` (write/edit)                 | YES   | Detects multi-file edits, warns about blast radius                      | MEDIUM — prevents accidental multi-file breaks          |
| `shazam-guide`        | `tool_result`                            | YES   | Auto-format + suggests related shazam tools                             | HIGH — auto-formats code, helps LLM discover tools      |
| `stop-verify`         | `tool_result` + `tool_call` + `turn_end` | YES   | Reminds to verify before ending turn, resets on new edits               | HIGH — prevents unverified edits                        |
| `failure-recovery`    | `tool_result`                            | YES   | Detects consecutive failures, suggests alternatives                     | MEDIUM — prevents LLM loops                             |
| `tool-logger`         | `tool_call` + `tool_result`              | YES   | Logs all shazam tool calls to JSONL file                                | LOW — debugging only, no LLM impact                     |
| `issue-guard`         | `tool_call` (bash) + `tool_result`       | YES   | Detects `gh issue create`, sets pending impact flag                     | MEDIUM — blocks edits until shazam_impact runs          |
| `agent-context-guard` | `tool_call` (agent)                      | YES   | Blocks agent spawn without structural context for review tasks          | MEDIUM — prevents contextless agent waste               |

## Core Flows

- **Overview injection**: `before_agent_start` event → `core/treesitter` scan (with persistent disk cache) → `core/pagerank` → format summary → inject into `systemPrompt` array
- **Tool call**: LLM calls tool → `tools/*.execute()` → `core/scanner` (disk cache → in-memory cache → incremental/full scan) → `core/` analysis → optional LSP enrichment via `tools/lsp_enrich.ts` (5s timeout, tree-sitter fallback) → return `AgentToolResult`
- **Verification**: LLM calls `shazam_verify` manually when needed (no automatic verification after edits).
- **Tool logging**: `tool_call` + `tool_result` events → `hooks/tool-logger` → writes JSONL to `~/.pi/hooks/audit/shazam-calls.log`
- **Agent guidance**: `before_agent_start` → `hooks/shazam-guide` → injects tool list into system prompt; `tool_result` (write/edit) → nudges `shazam_verify`; `tool_call` (grep/find) → nudges `shazam_lookup`
- **MCP tool calls**: MCP client → JSON-RPC over stdio → `mcp/tools.ts` → `core/` analysis + optional LSP enrichment (LspManager initialized in `mcp/entry.ts`) → return `{ content: [...] }`
- **LSP lifecycle**: extension load → `lsp/manager` detects project languages → spawns servers on demand → `lsp/client` handles JSON-RPC via vscode-jsonrpc over stdio → `session_shutdown` kills all

## API Surface

### LSP Methods on LspClient

`lsp/client.ts` exposes the following LSP protocol methods. Each returns `null` when the server is unavailable, the file is not opened, the server capability is missing, or the call times out (5s). Tools compose these via `tools/lsp_enrich.ts`.

| Method            | LSP request                        | Consumer                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `definition`      | `textDocument/definition`          | tools/lookup.ts                                            |
| `references`      | `textDocument/references`          | tools/impact.ts, tools/verify.ts                           |
| `hover`           | `textDocument/hover`               | tools/lookup.ts                                            |
| `documentSymbols` | `textDocument/documentSymbol`      | tools/lookup.ts (via `lspDocumentSymbols`)                 |
| `workspaceSymbol` | `workspace/symbol`                 | tools/lookup.ts (via `lspWorkspaceSearch`)                 |
| `semanticTokens`  | `textDocument/semanticTokens/full` | (wired via `lspSemanticTokens`, not yet consumed by tools) |
| `foldingRange`    | `textDocument/foldingRange`        | (wired via `lspFoldingRanges`, not yet consumed by tools)  |

### Registered Tools (LLM-visible)

| Tool                   | Value  | Style            | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shazam_overview`      | HIGH   | Scenario trigger | Project structure, deps, git history, hotspots — use first in unfamiliar projects                          |
| `shazam_lookup`        | HIGH   | Scenario trigger | Unified symbol/file lookup with type hierarchy, hover, file detail — auto-detects file path vs symbol name |
| `shazam_impact`        | HIGH   | Prerequisite     | Impact analysis + call chain tracing — required before editing 2+ files or shared modules                  |
| `shazam_verify`        | HIGH   | Action binding   | Post-edit verification gate (LSP diagnostics + graph analysis). PASS/WARN/FAIL                             |
| `shazam_changes`       | MEDIUM | Action binding   | Git change summary — changed files, affected symbols, risk level                                           |
| `shazam_format`        | MEDIUM | Action binding   | Auto-format code with nearest-wins formatters (prettier, biome, eslint, ruff, cargo fmt, gofmt)            |
| `shazam_find_tests`    | MEDIUM | Scenario trigger | Discover test files covering a module                                                                      |
| `shazam_rename_symbol` | LOW    | Prerequisite     | Safety gate before renaming — verify references first, then rename                                         |
| `shazam_safe_delete`   | LOW    | Prerequisite     | Safety gate before removal — verify zero incoming references first                                         |

All tools follow the same pattern:

- Parameters: TypeBox schema via direct `import { Type } from "typebox"`(Do not use `pi.typebox` — Pi runtime may not inject it, see pi-smart-fetch for reference)
- Output: `{ content: [{ type: "text", text: string }] }` — plain text for LLM reading
- Optional `{ json: true }` parameter for structured JSON output
- Write-operation tools support `{ dryRun: true }`

### Registered Commands

- `/shazam-setup` — detect installed language servers, output install instructions for missing ones
- `/shazam-doctor` — health check: verify tree-sitter grammars, LSP servers, cache integrity
- `/shazam-install-git-hooks` — install git pre-commit hook that runs shazam_verify --preCommit
- `/shazam-remove-git-hooks` — remove the shazam git pre-commit hook and restore original
- `/shazam-pre-commit-verify` — run pre-commit verification (used by the git hook script)

### Output Envelope (JSON mode)

```json
{
	"schema_version": "1.0",
	"command": "<tool_name>",
	"project": "<absolute_path>",
	"status": "ok",
	"result": {}
}
```

## Change Map

- **Adding a new tool**: Create `tools/<name>.ts` with `register*` function using `createTool(pi, { name, label, description, params, execute })` from `tools/_factory.ts` → import and call in `index.ts` → the factory auto-handles json/maxTokens params, scanProject, content envelope, and truncation → for complex async tools, use `customExecute` instead of `execute` → append Next recommendation rules to `NEXT_RULES` in `core/output.ts` (no switch to edit) → choose one of 5 description styles: Prerequisite, Scenario trigger, Consequence hint, Action binding, or Anti-pattern warning → sync the tool table in `AGENTS.md`, add full docs to `SKILL.md`, and update `README.md` if user-facing tool list changed
- **Adding a Next recommendation**: Append a `NextRule` object to `NEXT_RULES` in `core/output.ts`. Each rule: `{ forTools, condition(ctx, graph?), recommendation(ctx) }`. Rules evaluate against context + optional RepoGraph (for graph-aware filters like `hasTestFiles`, `hasHierarchyKinds`).
- **Adding a new language**: Add grammar to `core/treesitter.ts` EXT_TO_LANG map → add tree-sitter query in `core/treesitter-queries.ts` → add LSP server config in `lsp/servers.ts`
- **Changing graph algorithm**: Modify `core/pagerank.ts` or `core/graph.ts` → verify all tools that consume `RepoGraph` still produce correct output
- **Changing LSP protocol**: Modify `lsp/client.ts` → verify `lsp/manager.ts` lifecycle still works → test with at least 2 different language servers
- **Changing tool output format**: Update the specific `tools/*.ts` formatter → verify JSON envelope schema
- **Adding a new hook**: Create `hooks/<name>.ts` with a `register*` function that calls `pi.on(...)` → import and call in `index.ts` default export. Hooks subscribe to lifecycle events (`tool_execution_start`, `before_agent_start`, etc.) and do not return tools to the LLM. Add to hooks/ tree in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Adding a tool (MCP sync) [CRITICAL]**: After adding/changing/deleting a Pi tool → add/update/remove the matching `registerTool` in `mcp/tools.ts` → update `mcp/README.md` tool table → sync Pi tool description changes to MCP tool descriptions. MCP and Pi tools MUST stay in sync in the same PR. **Important**: MCP tools have SEPARATE definitions (using Zod) from Pi tools (using TypeBox). When changing:
  - Tool name: update `server.registerTool("shazam_*", ...)` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Tool description: update `description: "..."` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Tool parameters: update `inputSchema: z.object({...})` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Update `README.md` if user-facing tool list or usage changed
  - Run `./scripts/release.sh` to ensure everything is synced and deployed

## Issue Fix Workflow (Task Flow)

When fixing open issues, follow this workflow **without exception**. Pushing directly
to `main` is forbidden — every fix goes through a PR.

### Branch Naming Convention

| Pattern             | Usage                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `fix/issue-<NUM>`   | Single issue fix                     |
| `fix/issue-<A>-<B>` | Multiple related issues (2-5 issues) |
| `feat/<name>`       | New feature                          |
| `refactor/<name>`   | Refactoring                          |
| `docs/<name>`       | Documentation only                   |

### Commit Message Convention

```
fix(#<A>,#<B>): concise description

Optional detailed body explaining the fix.
```

- Reference all fixed issues in the subject line with `fix(#NNN)`.
- Use `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `docs:` prefixes.
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters when possible.

### CI Checks (ci.yml)

The CI workflow runs on both `push` to `main` and `pull_request` to `main`.
Do NOT merge until all jobs pass:

| Job           | What It Checks                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `typecheck`   | `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero type errors        |
| `test`        | `npm test` — all tests pass (ubuntu + macos) |
| `build`       | `npm run build` — `dist/` output exists      |
| `integration` | MCP integration smoke test                   |
| `benchmark`   | Performance benchmark tests                  |
| `security`    | `npm audit --omit=dev` — informational       |

### Anti-Patterns

- **NEVER push directly to `main`**. Always use a feature branch + PR.
- **NEVER skip CI**. Wait for all checks to pass before merging.
- **NEVER leave stale branches**. Use `--delete-branch` when merging or clean up
  with `git push origin --delete <branch>` afterward.
- **NEVER close issues before the PR is merged**. Close issues after merge.

### Post-Merge Cleanup

```bash
# Switch back to main and pull the merge commit
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete the local branch (remote already deleted by --delete-branch)
git branch -d fix/issue-<NUM>
```

## Release & Publish Workflow

### Release Notes & Changelog Requirements

**Every release MUST have detailed release notes and a CHANGELOG.md entry.** This is non-negotiable.

#### GitHub Release Notes

After creating a release, update the release notes with:

1. **What's Changed** section with subsections:
   - Features & Enhancements
   - Bug Fixes
   - Refactoring
   - Other
2. Each item should include:
   - Issue/PR number (e.g., `#199`)
   - Brief description of the change
   - Bullet points for specific details
3. **Upgrade** section with installation commands
4. **Full Changelog** link

Example:

````markdown
# v0.6.0

## What's Changed

### Features & Enhancements

- **enhance(#199): shazam_impact output now includes symbol-level detail** (#207)
  - Added risk assessment based on affected file and symbol counts
  - Added symbol grouping by file with upstream/downstream direction

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#196,#200): find_tests sourceFile parameter now searches tests/ directory** (#204)
  - Fixed sourceFile parameter to search project-root test directories

## Upgrade

```bash
npm install -g pi-shazam@latest --legacy-peer-deps
pi install npm:pi-shazam@latest
```
````

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/gjczone/pi-shazam/compare/v0.5.5...v0.6.0

````

#### CHANGELOG.md

Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` file in the project root following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:

1. Each version gets a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section
2. Same subsections as release notes (Features, Bug Fixes, Refactoring, Other)
3. Include issue/PR numbers for traceability
4. Keep entries concise but informative

#### Release Script Integration

The release script (`scripts/release.sh`) creates a minimal release. After running it:

1. Edit the GitHub Release to add detailed notes
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with the same information
3. Commit CHANGELOG.md changes

### Quick Release (Recommended)

Use the automated release script:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh patch  # or minor, major
````

This script handles everything:

1. Bumps version in package.json
2. Syncs version to all surfaces (mcp/entry.ts, AGENTS.md, docs/INSTRUCTION.md)
3. Builds and tests
4. Commits and tags
5. Pushes to GitHub
6. Creates GitHub Release (triggers npm publish)
7. Updates local Pi extension (`pi update`)
8. Updates global npm install
9. Verifies all installations

**After running the release script, you MUST (non-negotiable, never skip):**

> ⚠️ **A release without CHANGELOG.md is an INCOMPLETE release.** The release script
> does NOT update CHANGELOG.md — this is a manual step that MUST happen every time.
> If you run `release.sh` and forget CHANGELOG.md, go back and fix it immediately.

1. Update the GitHub Release with detailed notes (see above)
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the same information — use the format `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   with subsections: Features & Enhancements, Bug Fixes, Refactoring, Other
3. Commit and push CHANGELOG.md changes

**Checklist before declaring release done:**

- [ ] GitHub Release has detailed notes (not just "See CHANGELOG")
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has a `[X.Y.Z]` entry with all changes listed
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` changes committed and pushed

### Manual Publishing (If Needed)

**DO NOT use `npm publish` directly.** Local npm tokens expire easily. Publishing is done via GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.

Manual workflow:

1. After development is complete and tests pass, commit code to branch
2. `npm version patch` (or `minor`/`major`) → automatically creates git tag
3. Sync version to mcp/entry.ts, AGENTS.md, docs/INSTRUCTION.md
4. `git push origin <branch> --tags`
5. Create GitHub Release (`gh release create vX.Y.Z`)
6. Release publish event automatically triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
7. After npm publish, run:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pi-shazam@latest --legacy-peer-deps
   pi update
   ```

> See `.github/workflows/publish.yml` for publish CI details.

> See [INSTRUCTION.md](./docs/INSTRUCTION.md) section 1.4 for tool parameter schema notes.

## Verification Matrix

### After Every Change (Mandatory)

| Step | Command                                | What it checks            |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1    | `npm run typecheck`                    | Type safety               |
| 2    | `npm test`                             | all tests pass            |
| 3    | `npm run build`                        | Compile output            |
| 4    | `pi -p "call shazam_overview briefly"` | Pi integration smoke test |

### Pi Integration Testing

```bash
# Install into Pi
pi install npm:pi-shazam@latest     # from npm
# OR copy local build:
cp dist/**/*.js ~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-shazam/dist/ -r

# Smoke test all tools
pi -p "call shazam_overview briefly"
pi -p "call shazam_verify"
pi -p "call shazam_lookup"

# Check: no "Extension error" in output, tools return meaningful results.
```

### MCP Testing

```bash
printf '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}\n{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"shazam_overview","arguments":{}}}\n' | timeout 15 node dist/mcp/entry.js . 2>/dev/null | tail -1
```

### Hook Verification

```bash
# Verify all hooks registered in built dist
grep -c "registerBeforeStartHook\|registerToolLogger\|registerShazamGuide\|registerPreEditGuard\|registerSafetyHooks\|registerStopVerify\|registerFailureRecovery\|registerIssueGuard\|registerAgentContextGuard" dist/index.js
# Should output: 9

# Verify system prompt injection works (no crash)
pi -p "call shazam_overview" 2>&1 | grep -q "Extension error" && echo "FAIL" || echo "OK"
```

### Pre-Publish Contract Check (Mandatory)

Refer to `docs/INSTRUCTION.md` §1 for the complete contract documentation.

```
□ grep "pi\.logger\." dist/          # No unprotected direct calls
□ grep "pi\.typebox" dist/           # No references
□ grep "content:" dist/index.js      # sendMessage: string format
□ grep "content:" dist/hooks/*.js    # sendMessage: string format
□ grep "content:" dist/tools/*.js    # Tool returns: [{type:"text", text:...}]
□ grep "systemPrompt:" dist/hooks/   # Returns string, not Array
```

## First Places to Inspect

- `index.ts` — extension entry, all registrations
- `core/treesitter.ts` — language support, symbol extraction entry
- `core/graph.ts` — how symbols become a dependency graph
- `core/scanner.ts` — project scanning + graph building
- `core/redact.ts` — shared secret redaction
- `core/formatters.ts` — formatter detection
- `core/audit-log.ts` — audit log rotation
- `core/output.ts` — standardized tool output formatting + Next recommendation rules
- `core/git-hooks.ts` — git pre-commit hook integration
- `lsp/client.ts` — LSP JSON-RPC implementation
- `tools/_factory.ts` — createTool() factory: eliminates per-tool boilerplate
- `tools/overview.ts` — representative tool using the factory (others follow same shape)
- `hooks/before-start.ts` — system prompt injection pattern

## Docs Directory

Project documentation lives under `docs/`. Each guide covers a specific topic —
when working on that topic, read the corresponding guide first.

| Guide                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# General Project Rules

## Coding Rules

- Layer boundaries: `core/` must not import from `tools/`, `hooks/`, or `lsp/`. Tools compose core; hooks compose tools.
- Tool registration: Every tool file exports a `register*(pi: ExtensionAPI)` function. The registration happens in `index.ts` default export.
- Output format: All tools return plain text by default, structured JSON when `{ json: true }` is passed. Never mix formats.
- LSP degradation: When LSP server is unavailable, fall back to tree-sitter only. Annotate output with "(tree-sitter only, LSP unavailable)". Never throw on missing LSP.
- Encoding: Always use `core/encoding.ts` adaptive reader (UTF-8 → GBK → GB2312). Never assume UTF-8 for source files.
- Tool descriptions: Write clear, specific `description` strings for every registered tool — these are what the LLM reads to decide when to call.
- CI: GitHub Actions runs on push/PR to main. Check CI status before merging. Never skip CI.
- PRs: One vertical slice per PR — build a complete module (core + tool + typecheck), then merge. No big-bang PRs.
- TDD: Write the test first for every slice. Watch it fail, implement, verify, commit.
- AGENTS.md: Update this file whenever a new module, tool, command, or data flow is created.

## Testing Rules

- Type correctness: Run `npm run typecheck` after every change. This is the minimum verification gate.
- Integration testing: Symlink `dist/` into Pi extensions directory and verify tool calls in a live Pi session.
- Test repos: Use `~/.A1/repomap` itself as a test target — it has Python + tree-sitter + LSP scenarios.

## Debugging Rules

- Tree-sitter parse failures: Check grammar version compatibility in `package.json`. Run parse on a single file with verbose logging.
- LSP communication errors: Check `lsp/client.ts` JSON-RPC frame parsing. Common issues: Content-Length mismatch, incomplete reads, server crash on initialize.
- Tool not appearing in Pi: Verify `register*` is called in `index.ts`. Check Pi extension loading logs. Verify the tool name doesn't conflict with existing Pi tools.

## Verification Before Completion

- Every module: `npm run typecheck` passes with zero errors.
- Every tool: callable from Pi, returns non-empty text output on a sample project.
- Every hook: triggers correctly on the appropriate event in a live Pi session.
- Every LSP feature: at least one language server responds correctly to the relevant LSP method.

## Project-Specific Rules

- **LANGUAGE RULE**: All source code, code comments, JSDoc, commit messages, PR titles/descriptions, GitHub Issue content, and GitHub Release notes MUST be written in English. No Chinese or any other non-English language in any artifact that goes into the repository. This is a hard requirement for this project.
- **DEVELOPMENT RULE**: All development and maintenance of this project MUST follow the conventions, workflows, and contracts defined in `docs/INSTRUCTION.md`. This includes Pi extension API contracts, architecture layer boundaries, tool registration patterns, content format contracts, release process, and verification gates. `INSTRUCTION.md` is the single source of truth — read it before making any change.
- **No emoji or decorative symbols.** Emoji (✅❌🔴🟡🟢🆕⚠️💡 etc.), Unicode decorative characters, and ASCII art are forbidden in all source files, tool output, code comments, and commit messages. The only allowed symbols are standard ASCII punctuation and Markdown formatting characters. This rule applies to all repository artifacts except `AGENTS.md` itself (this file) and `SKILL.md`.
- **Tool output must be clean.** Tool output text returned to the LLM must be minimal, structured, and free of noise. Specifically:
  - No emoji, no decorative Unicode, no ANSI escape codes
  - No "friendly" filler phrases — be direct and factual
  - Consistent heading hierarchy (`## tool_name`, `### section`)
  - Numerical data in tables or key-value pairs, not prose
  - Truncation explicitly flagged (`... and N more`)
  - No trailing whitespace, no excessive blank lines
- Pi extension API: Import types from `./types/pi-extension.js` (local stub). Use `ExtensionAPI`, `ExtensionContext`, `AgentToolResult` — do not redefine these types.
- Tool naming: Prefix all tools with `shazam_` to avoid conflicts with other Pi extensions.
- Symbol IDs: Format as `{file}::{name}::{line}` to match the repomap convention. Keep this stable — other tools depend on it.
