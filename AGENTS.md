## User System Rules

# Rules

## 0) Hard Boundaries (Highest Priority — Never Violated)

### Scope Lock

- **NEVER** introduce new third-party dependencies unless the task explicitly requires it.
- **NEVER** create new files unrelated to the current task.
- **NEVER** modify interface signatures, function behavior, or code formatting outside the task scope under the guise of "maintaining compatibility" or "unifying style."
- **NEVER** proactively refactor existing code under the guise of "function too long" or "messy file structure" unless explicitly instructed.
- **NEVER** delete, merge, or relocate modules without an explicit migration instruction.

**Opportunistic fixes — fix on sight, report in completion report:**
When encountering a pre-existing issue that is unrelated to the current task, fix it immediately — without asking — if and only if ALL of the following are true:

1. No refactoring involved (moving, renaming, restructuring code).
2. No new dependencies required.
3. The fix is self-contained and low-risk (a typo, a missing null check, an unused import, an empty catch block, an obvious off-by-one, a broken log message).

If the issue fails any of the three criteria above — stop, do not touch it, and report it under **Follow-up** in the completion report.

### Data & Security

- **NEVER** fabricate tool outputs, test results, logs, or any external confirmations.
- **NEVER** hardcode where constants, enums, or shared definitions are appropriate.
- **NEVER** skip security review on auth, permissions, secrets, file access, execution paths, or user input.
- **NEVER** duplicate shared business rules, cache keys, or classification logic across multiple locations.

### Quality Gates

- **NEVER** ignore type errors, build errors, failing tests, or command failures.
- **NEVER** validate only the happy path — boundary cases and repeated runs must be covered.
- **NEVER** modify or add code paths outside the task scope in order to handle edge cases — discover the issue, report it, do not self-extend.
- Every `except` / `catch` / `match Err` branch **MUST** either handle the error with a log or propagate it. Empty catch blocks are forbidden. Log: what operation failed, the input context, and the original error message.

---

## 1) Basic Norms

- Address the user as `老板`.
- Default to Simplified Chinese. Use English only for code, commands, technical terms, commit types, and tool names.
- Treat the user as non-technical unless they clearly ask for engineering detail. Explain in business terms first.
- Do not dump code unless the user asks for it.
- Comments added to code must explain: business purpose, implementation logic, and edge cases. Use Chinese; avoid jargon.

---

## 2) Tool Invocation

- When a relevant skill or MCP tool exists for the task, invoke it directly — do not ask first.
- **NEVER** fall back to raw shell commands when a better tool alternative is available.

---

## 3) Execution Discipline

### 3.1 Before Acting

- State assumptions explicitly when meaning is unclear — never guess.
- When the requested approach is heavier than necessary, propose a simpler path.
- When business logic or domain rules are unclear, ask once rather than assume.

### 3.2 Change Discipline

- Do only what the user asked. Prefer the smallest change that solves the request.
- Fix broken things on sight — build errors, missing dependencies, type errors, broken commands — regardless of whether the current task introduced them.
- Apply opportunistic fixes per the criteria in §0 Scope Lock. Do not ask for permission; just fix and report under **Opportunistic fixes** in the completion report.
- Do not touch naming, formatting, or architecture preferences unless the task explicitly requires it.
- When replacing a component, function, or module: ① grep all references, ② update them, ③ delete the old file — all in the same change. No leftover references. No compatibility wrappers.

### 3.3 Verifiable Execution

- Execute autonomously. Do not stop and ask for confirmation between steps — keep going until the task is complete or you hit a blocker.
- Stop and ask only when: (a) verification fails and you cannot fix it, (b) business meaning or domain rules are unclear, (c) a destructive action has no safety net, or (d) the user explicitly asked to be consulted.
- On verification failure: stop immediately, report what failed and why. Do not self-patch tests or silently work around the failure.
- For multi-step tasks, list the plan first, then execute all steps autonomously:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

---

## 4) Completion Report

Trigger only when the task or milestone is fully completed:

```markdown

```

---

## 5) Code Structure

### 5.1 Function Scope

- **NEVER** write a function that does more than one thing. If the name needs "and" to describe its purpose, split it.
- This rule applies only to new or modified functions within the task scope. **NEVER** proactively refactor existing functions on this basis.

### 5.2 File Boundaries

- One file = one business concept. Any file with a generic name (`utils`, `helpers`, `common`, `misc`) that spans multiple unrelated domains is a boundary violation — regardless of line count.
- When a file directly touched by the task contains 2+ unrelated domains, extract each into its own file. **NEVER** proactively scan the codebase to clean this up.
- **NEVER** create a module file that only re-exports another module's symbols — inline the imports at call sites instead.

### 5.3 API Calls

- Before writing any code that calls your project's own backend (regardless of language or library), read `rules/api.d.ts` first. Endpoint path, HTTP method, request shape, and response shape must match exactly.
- External library APIs → query `context7` MCP. Your project's own API → read `rules/api.d.ts`. **NEVER** guess either.
- If `rules/api.d.ts` does not exist or the needed endpoint is missing: update `rules/api.d.ts` first, then implement both backend and frontend together. **NEVER** write client code against an undocumented endpoint.

---

## 6) Toolchain

- **Python**: ALL operations MUST go through `uv`. **NEVER** invoke `python`, `pip`, `venv`, or `virtualenv` directly.
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**: Use the package manager already present in the project (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` — determined by the lockfile). **NEVER** mix package managers in the same project.
- When the project's toolchain is not covered above, check the project-level for toolchain rules before using any default.

# pi-shazam

Pi coding agent native codebase awareness extension. "Shazam" — like the superhero whose power comes from multiple deities, pi-shazam unifies the strength of multiple analysis engines (repomap/aider, pi-lens, serena MCP, tree-sitter, LSP) into one coherent interface for the agent.

Rewrites the Python CLI project [repomap](https://github.com/gjczone/repomap) as a native Pi extension in TypeScript. All analysis capabilities register as first-class Pi tools — LLM sees them alongside `read`/`write`/`bash` with no distinction.

## shazam Tools — USE THEM

You have access to pi-shazam — 7 code analysis tools. You WILL use every one of them. They are NOT optional.

**`shazam_overview` is ALREADY in your context.** It was auto-injected before you started reading. READ it. The project structure, top files, and hotspots are right there above this section. If you can see the overview output in your context — Do NOT call `shazam_overview`. If you do NOT see it — call it immediately. It is the single most important tool. You cannot work blind.

Here are the other 6 tools. You MUST call them. Memorize them. Use them or fail.

| Tool                   | What it does                                                                       | You MUST call it when                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shazam_lookup`        | Symbol/file details — hover info, type hierarchy, callers, callees, concept search | You need to understand any symbol, file, or "how is X implemented"                |
| `shazam_impact`        | Blast radius — every file, symbol, and test affected by your change                | BEFORE editing shared or exported modules. Do NOT guess what you'll break.        |
| `shazam_verify`        | Post-edit gate — LSP diagnostics, graph analysis, PASS/WARN/FAIL                   | AFTER every write. Run it. Read the verdict. If it says FAIL or WARN, fix it NOW. |
| `shazam_changes`       | Git change summary with symbol-level detail and risk level                         | You edited things and need to know what actually changed                          |
| `shazam_format`        | Auto-fix formatting — supports multiple formatters                                 | `shazam_verify` reports format errors                                             |
| `shazam_rename_symbol` | Cross-file symbol rename with atomic writes and safety gate                        | Renaming ANY symbol. Do NOT manually find-and-replace.                            |

If a tool errors or is unavailable, try once more, then work around it. But you MUST try it first. These tools are the difference between a working change and a broken build.

## When to Read Rules Files

- Read `rules/CODING.md` before writing or modifying code. Layer boundaries and tool registration patterns live here.
- Read `rules/REVIEW-RULES.md` before performing a code review. NEVER submit findings that violate the DO NOT REPORT rules.

## When to Read Companion Files

| File                      | Directive                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Trigger                                                                             |

## Project Snapshot

- **Language**: TypeScript (ES2022, ESM), Node.js >= 18
- **What it does**: Codebase graph construction (tree-sitter AST -> symbols -> dependencies -> PageRank), LSP integration, and safe code modification tools
- **Package manager**: npm (lockfile: `package-lock.json`)
- **Deployment**: Pi extension (symlink dist/ into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-shazam`) + MCP server (`npx pi-shazam-mcp`)
- **Test framework**: vitest, 48 TypeScript source files, tests in `tests/`
- **Key boundaries**: `core/` must never import from `tools/`, `hooks/`, or `lsp/`. Zero HTTP framework, zero ORM, zero auth.
- **Primary risk areas**: tree-sitter grammar version compatibility, LSP JSON-RPC frame parsing, encoding fallback (UTF-8/GBK/GB2312), MCP/Pi tool definition sync

## Commands

| Command                          | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `bash scripts/ci.sh`             | Local CI quick gate — run before every commit                        |
| `bash scripts/release.sh`        | Release operations — run through ALL checklist items when publishing |

## Architecture

4 layers: `hooks/` -> `tools/` -> `core/` + `lsp/`. Dependency direction is one-way downward. `core/` has zero Pi or LSP imports. Tools compose core and enrich with LSP data. Hooks call tool logic and inject into LLM context via `pi.sendMessage()`.

## API Surface

- **Pi Extension API**: `types/pi-extension.d.ts` — self-contained `ExtensionAPI` type stub. Import as `from "./types/pi-extension.js"`. Key types: `ExtensionAPI`, `ExtensionContext`, `AgentToolResult`.
- **Tool registration**: `tools/_factory.ts` → `createTool(pi, { name, label, description, params, execute })`. Registration happens in `index.ts` default export.
- **MCP server**: `mcp/tools.ts` uses Zod schemas from `tools/definitions.ts`. MCP and Pi tools MUST stay in sync within the same PR.

## Data & State Flows

| Variable / Cache                 | Type                                                | Purpose                                                     | Reset trigger                                         |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Module-level cached scan results | In-memory                                           | `scanProject()` result reused across tools within a session | New tool call with `scanProject` flag, or session end |
| LSP client connections           | Process                                             | Spawned language server processes per language              | Session end, server crash, or explicit shutdown       |
| Audit log                        | File (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-shazam/audit.log`) | All tool invocations                                        | Log rotation (10 MB cap)                              |
| Graph cache                      | In-memory                                           | RepoGraph built from tree-sitter parse                      | File change detected, or session end                  |

## Security

- **Project root validation**: `core/scanner.ts` `getEffectiveRoot()` validates project root; never trust user-supplied paths blindly.
- **File path sanitization**: All file paths resolved against project root; path traversal (`../`) outside root is rejected.
- **Secrets detection**: `shazam_verify` includes secrets detection (`noSecrets: false` by default). Never commit files containing detected secrets.
- **Audit logging**: All tool invocations logged to audit file with timestamp, tool name, and parameters. Sensitive parameter values are redacted.
- **LSP processes**: Auto-spawned language servers run as child processes; stdin/stdout communication only, no network exposure.

## Debugging Guide

| Symptom                               | Likely cause                             | Check                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tree-sitter parse returns empty       | Grammar version mismatch                 | `package.json` `overrides` for `tree-sitter` version                     |
| LSP tool returns "(tree-sitter only)" | Language server not installed or crashed | Run `/shazam-setup` to check LSP availability                            |
| LSP communication errors              | JSON-RPC frame parsing                   | `lsp/client.ts` Content-Length header mismatch, incomplete reads         |
| Tool not appearing in Pi              | Registration missing                     | Verify `register*` called in `index.ts`; check Pi extension loading logs |
| Test failures with stream errors      | vscode-jsonrpc pre-existing issue        | `vitest.setup.ts` suppresses these; not a real bug                       |
| Encoding errors on source read        | Non-UTF-8 file                           | `core/encoding.ts` adaptive reader tries UTF-8 -> GBK -> GB2312          |

## Change Map

- **Adding a new tool**: Create `tools/<name>.ts` with `register*` function using `createTool()` from `tools/_factory.ts` -> import and call in `index.ts` -> append Next recommendation rules to `NEXT_RULES` in `core/output.ts` -> sync in `mcp/tools.ts` and `mcp/README.md` -> add docs to `SKILL.md` -> update `README.md` if user-facing tool list changed.
- **Adding a new hook**: Create `hooks/<name>.ts` with `register*` calling `pi.on(...)` -> import and call in `index.ts`. Hooks listen to lifecycle events (`tool_execution_start`, `before_agent_start`, etc.); they do not return tools to LLM.
- **Adding a new language**: Add grammar to `core/treesitter.ts` EXT_TO_LANG map -> add tree-sitter query in `core/treesitter-queries.ts` -> add LSP server config in `lsp/servers.ts`.
- **Wiring a shared utility**: Add function to appropriate `core/*.ts` -> export -> import in consumers from `../core/<file>.js`. `core/` is the only valid home for cross-layer utilities.
- **Changing LSP protocol**: Modify `lsp/client.ts` -> verify `lsp/manager.ts` lifecycle -> test with at least 2 different language servers.
- **Changing tool output format**: Update the specific `tools/*.ts` formatter -> verify JSON envelope schema (all tools support `{ json: true }`).
- **Changing tool names, adding/removing tools, or changing tool behaviors**: After the code change, read `docs/kimi-code-hooks.md` -> run through the checklist -> update version mapping table -> sync Kimi Code shell hooks if needed. Kimi Code uses MCP format (`mcp__pi-shazam__shazam_<name>`); old tool names in shell hooks will silently fail on Kimi Code.

## First Places to Inspect

- `index.ts` — extension entry, all registrations
- `core/treesitter.ts` — language support, symbol extraction
- `core/graph.ts` — dependency graph construction
- `core/output.ts` — shared utilities: `_logWarn`, `NEXT_RULES`, `truncateOutput`
- `core/scanner.ts` — project scanning, `getEffectiveRoot()`
- `lsp/client.ts` — LSP JSON-RPC communication
- `tools/_factory.ts` — tool registration factory
- `vitest.config.ts` — test runner config (suppresses pre-existing stream errors)
- `docs/INSTRUCTION.md` — single source of truth for contracts and conventions

## Project-Specific Rules

- **LANGUAGE RULE**: All source code, code comments, JSDoc, commit messages, PR titles/descriptions, GitHub Issue content, and GitHub Release notes MUST be written in English. No Chinese or any other non-English language in any artifact that goes into the repository.
- **No emoji or decorative symbols**: Forbidden in all source files, tool output, code comments, and commit messages. Only standard ASCII punctuation and Markdown formatting allowed. Exception: `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md`.
- **Tool output must be clean**: No emoji, no decorative Unicode, no ANSI escape codes. No "friendly" filler phrases. Consistent heading hierarchy. Truncation explicitly flagged. No trailing whitespace.
- **Tool naming**: Prefix all tools with `shazam_` to avoid conflicts.
- **Symbol IDs**: Format as `{file}::{name}::{line}` — keeps repomap convention.
- **LSP degradation**: When LSP is unavailable, fall back to tree-sitter only. Annotate output with "(tree-sitter only, LSP unavailable)". Never throw on missing LSP.
- **Encoding**: Always use `core/encoding.ts` adaptive reader (UTF-8 -> GBK -> GB2312). Never assume UTF-8.
- **TDD**: Write the test first for every slice. Verify it fails, implement, verify it passes, commit.
- **PR scope**: One vertical slice per PR — build a complete module (core + tool + typecheck), then merge. No big-bang PRs.
