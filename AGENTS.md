## User System Rules

# Rules

## 0) Hard Boundaries (Highest Priority — Never Violated)

### Scope Lock

- **NEVER** introduce new third-party dependencies unless the task explicitly requires it.
- **NEVER** create new files unrelated to the current task.
- **NEVER** modify interface signatures, function behavior, or code formatting outside the task scope under the guise of "maintaining compatibility" or "unifying style."
- **NEVER** proactively refactor existing code under the guise of "function too long" or "messy file structure" unless explicitly instructed.
- **NEVER** delete, merge, or relocate modules without an explicit migration instruction.

**Opportunistic fixes — fix on sight, report in completion report:**
When encountering a pre-existing issue that is unrelated to the current task, fix it immediately — without asking — if and only if ALL of the following are true:

1. No refactoring involved (moving, renaming, restructuring code).
2. No new dependencies required.
3. The fix is self-contained and low-risk (a typo, a missing null check, an unused import, an empty catch block, an obvious off-by-one, a broken log message).

If the issue fails any of the three criteria above — stop, do not touch it, and report it under **Follow-up** in the completion report.

### Data & Security

- **NEVER** fabricate tool outputs, test results, logs, or any external confirmations.
- **NEVER** hardcode where constants, enums, or shared definitions are appropriate.
- **NEVER** skip security review on auth, permissions, secrets, file access, execution paths, or user input.
- **NEVER** duplicate shared business rules, cache keys, or classification logic across multiple locations.

### Quality Gates

- **NEVER** ignore type errors, build errors, failing tests, or command failures.
- **NEVER** validate only the happy path — boundary cases and repeated runs must be covered.
- **NEVER** modify or add code paths outside the task scope in order to handle edge cases — discover the issue, report it, do not self-extend.
- Every `except` / `catch` / `match Err` branch **MUST** either handle the error with a log or propagate it. Empty catch blocks are forbidden. Log: what operation failed, the input context, and the original error message.

---

## 1) Basic Norms

- Address the user as `老板`.
- Default to Simplified Chinese. Use English only for code, commands, technical terms, commit types, and tool names.
- Treat the user as non-technical unless they clearly ask for engineering detail. Explain in business terms first.
- Do not dump code unless the user asks for it.
- Comments added to code must explain: business purpose, implementation logic, and edge cases. Use Chinese; avoid jargon.

---

## 2) Tool Invocation

- When a relevant skill or MCP tool exists for the task, invoke it directly — do not ask first.
- **NEVER** fall back to raw shell commands when a better tool alternative is available.

---

## 3) Execution Discipline

### 3.1 Before Acting

- State assumptions explicitly when meaning is unclear — never guess.
- When the requested approach is heavier than necessary, propose a simpler path.
- When business logic or domain rules are unclear, ask once rather than assume.

### 3.2 Change Discipline

- Do only what the user asked. Prefer the smallest change that solves the request.
- Fix broken things on sight — build errors, missing dependencies, type errors, broken commands — regardless of whether the current task introduced them.
- Apply opportunistic fixes per the criteria in §0 Scope Lock. Do not ask for permission; just fix and report under **Opportunistic fixes** in the completion report.
- Do not touch naming, formatting, or architecture preferences unless the task explicitly requires it.
- When replacing a component, function, or module: ① grep all references, ② update them, ③ delete the old file — all in the same change. No leftover references. No compatibility wrappers.

### 3.3 Verifiable Execution

- Execute autonomously. Do not stop and ask for confirmation between steps — keep going until the task is complete or you hit a blocker.
- Stop and ask only when: (a) verification fails and you cannot fix it, (b) business meaning or domain rules are unclear, (c) a destructive action has no safety net, or (d) the user explicitly asked to be consulted.
- On verification failure: stop immediately, report what failed and why. Do not self-patch tests or silently work around the failure.
- For multi-step tasks, list the plan first, then execute all steps autonomously:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

---

## 4) Completion Report

Trigger only when the task or milestone is fully completed:

```markdown

```

---

## 5) Code Structure

### 5.1 Function Scope

- **NEVER** write a function that does more than one thing. If the name needs "and" to describe its purpose, split it.
- This rule applies only to new or modified functions within the task scope. **NEVER** proactively refactor existing functions on this basis.

### 5.2 File Boundaries

- One file = one business concept. Any file with a generic name (`utils`, `helpers`, `common`, `misc`) that spans multiple unrelated domains is a boundary violation — regardless of line count.
- When a file directly touched by the task contains 2+ unrelated domains, extract each into its own file. **NEVER** proactively scan the codebase to clean this up.
- **NEVER** create a module file that only re-exports another module's symbols — inline the imports at call sites instead.

### 5.3 API Calls

- Before writing any code that calls your project's own backend (regardless of language or library), read `./api.d.ts` first. Endpoint path, HTTP method, request shape, and response shape must match exactly.
- External library APIs → query `context7` MCP. Your project's own API → read `./api.d.ts`. **NEVER** guess either.
- If `api.d.ts` does not exist or the needed endpoint is missing: update `api.d.ts` first, then implement both backend and frontend together. **NEVER** write client code against an undocumented endpoint.

---

## 6) Toolchain

- **Python**: ALL operations MUST go through `uv`. **NEVER** invoke `python`, `pip`, `venv`, or `virtualenv` directly.
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**: Use the package manager already present in the project (`npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` — determined by the lockfile). **NEVER** mix package managers in the same project.
- When the project's toolchain is not covered above, check the project-level for toolchain rules before using any default.

# pi-shazam

Pi coding agent native codebase awareness extension. "Shazam" — like the superhero whose power comes from multiple deities, pi-shazam unifies the strength of multiple analysis engines (repomap/aider, pi-lens, serena MCP, tree-sitter, LSP) into one coherent interface for the agent.

Rewrites the Python CLI project [repomap](https://github.com/gjczone/repomap) as a native Pi extension in TypeScript. All analysis capabilities register as first-class Pi tools — LLM sees them alongside `read`/`write`/`bash` with no distinction.

## When to Read Rules Files

## Development Environment

- Node.js >= 18, npm as package manager
- `types/pi-extension.d.ts` provides self-contained `ExtensionAPI` type stub (extracted from Pi coding agent runtime at `~/.pi/`, scope `@earendil-works/pi-*`)
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` required due to tree-sitter grammar peer dependency conflicts
- `tree-sitter@^0.22.4` pinned via `overrides` in package.json
- `vscode-languageserver-protocol` for LSP type definitions
- `iconv-lite` for UTF-8/GBK/GB2312 encoding fallback
- Test the extension by symlinking `dist/` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-shazam` or configuring in Pi settings

## Dependency API Reference (context7 verified 2026-06)

### tree-sitter (node-tree-sitter v0.22.4)

- **Parser**: `import Parser from "tree-sitter"` -> `new Parser()` -> `parser.setLanguage(new Language(grammarModule))`
- **Parsing**: `parser.parse(sourceString)` returns `Tree`; `tree.rootNode` for root `SyntaxNode`
- **Query**: `new Query(language, queryString)` -> `query.captures(node)` returns `{name: string, node: SyntaxNode}[]`
- **No QueryCursor**: Node.js binding does not have Python's `QueryCursor` class, use `query.captures()` directly
- **Node properties**: `node.type`, `node.text`, `node.children`, `node.parent`, `node.previousSibling`, `node.startPosition`/`endPosition` (`.row`/`.column`), `node.childForFieldName("name")`
- **Grammar loading**: `new Language(grammarModule)` wraps native module, not Python's `Language(fn())` constructor pattern
- **Input type**: `parse()` accepts `string` or callback `(index, position) => string | null`, not Buffer
- **No built-in .d.ts**: Need to declare types manually or use `@types/tree-sitter`

### vscode-languageserver-protocol (v3.18.0) + vscode-jsonrpc (v9.0.0)

- **Protocol types**: Import `Diagnostic`, `Location`, `Position`, `Range`, `SymbolKind`, `InitializeParams`, `InitializeResult`, `TextDocumentItem`, `DidOpenTextDocumentParams`, `ReferenceContext` etc. from `vscode-languageserver-protocol`
- **LSP client communication**: Use `vscode-jsonrpc/node`'s `StreamMessageReader` / `StreamMessageWriter` + `createMessageConnection` instead of hand-written Content-Length frame parsing. This is the officially recommended client pattern, and `vscode-jsonrpc@9.0.0` is already a transitive dependency
- **Usage example**: `import * as rpc from "vscode-jsonrpc/node"` -> `rpc.createMessageConnection(new rpc.StreamMessageReader(child.stdout), new rpc.StreamMessageWriter(child.stdin))` -> `connection.sendRequest(method, params)` / `connection.onNotification(type, handler)`
- **Do not use createConnection**: `createConnection` is a server-side API (for building language servers), this project is a client and does not need it

## Architecture

4 layers: `hooks/` -> `tools/` -> `core/` + `lsp/`. `core/` has zero Pi or LSP imports. Tools compose core and enrich with LSP data. Hooks call tool logic and inject into LLM context.

### Layer dependency direction

`hooks/` -> `tools/` -> `core/` + `lsp/`. The `core/` layer has zero Pi or LSP imports. Tools compose core functions and optionally enrich with LSP data. Hooks call tool logic directly and inject results into LLM context via `pi.sendMessage()`.

## Change Map

- **Adding a new tool**: Create `tools/<name>.ts` with `register*` function using `createTool(pi, { name, label, description, params, execute })` from `tools/_factory.ts` -> import and call in `index.ts` -> the factory auto-handles json/maxTokens params, scanProject, content envelope, and truncation -> for complex async tools, use `customExecute` instead of `execute` -> append Next recommendation rules to `NEXT_RULES` in `core/output.ts` (no switch to edit) -> choose one of 5 description styles: Prerequisite, Scenario trigger, Consequence hint, Action binding, or Anti-pattern warning -> sync the tool table in `AGENTS.md`, add full docs to `SKILL.md`, and update `README.md` if user-facing tool list changed
- **Adding a Next recommendation**: Append a `NextRule` object to `NEXT_RULES` in `core/output.ts`. Each rule: `{ forTools, condition(ctx, graph?), recommendation(ctx) }`. Rules evaluate against context + optional RepoGraph (for graph-aware filters like `hasTestFiles`, `hasHierarchyKinds`).
- **Adding a new language**: Add grammar to `core/treesitter.ts` EXT_TO_LANG map -> add tree-sitter query in `core/treesitter-queries.ts` -> add LSP server config in `lsp/servers.ts`
- **Changing graph algorithm**: Modify `core/pagerank.ts` or `core/graph.ts` -> verify all tools that consume `RepoGraph` still produce correct output
- **Changing LSP protocol**: Modify `lsp/client.ts` -> verify `lsp/manager.ts` lifecycle still works -> test with at least 2 different language servers
- **Changing tool output format**: Update the specific `tools/*.ts` formatter -> verify JSON envelope schema
- **Adding a new hook**: Create `hooks/<name>.ts` with a `register*` function that calls `pi.on(...)` -> import and call in `index.ts` default export. Hooks subscribe to lifecycle events (`tool_execution_start`, `before_agent_start`, etc.) and do not return tools to the LLM. Add to hooks/ tree in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Adding a tool (MCP sync) [CRITICAL]**: After adding/changing/deleting a Pi tool -> add/update/remove the matching `registerTool` in `mcp/tools.ts` -> update `mcp/README.md` tool table -> sync Pi tool description changes to MCP tool descriptions. MCP and Pi tools MUST stay in sync in the same PR. **Important**: MCP tools have SEPARATE definitions (using Zod) from Pi tools (using TypeBox). When changing:
  - Tool name: update `server.registerTool("shazam_*", ...)` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Tool description: update `description: "..."` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Tool parameters: update `inputSchema: z.object({...})` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Update `README.md` if user-facing tool list or usage changed
  - Run `./scripts/release.sh` to ensure everything is synced and deployed
- **Adding a shared utility to core/**: Add the function to the appropriate `core/*.ts` file -> export it -> import in all consumers from `../core/<file>.js` -> if the utility is used across layers, `core/` is the only valid home (layer boundary: `core/` must not import from `tools/`, `hooks/`, or `lsp/`)
- **Fixing test environment issues**: Check `vitest.config.ts` (test runner settings) and `vitest.setup.ts` (global process handlers) before assuming a test failure is a real bug — pre-existing stream destruction errors from vscode-jsonrpc are suppressed in `vitest.setup.ts`

## First Places to Inspect

Key entry points — shazam_overview "Suggested Reading Order" provides the full list:

- `index.ts` — extension entry, all registrations
- `core/treesitter.ts` — language support, symbol extraction
- `core/graph.ts` — dependency graph
- `core/output.ts` — shared utilities: `_logWarn`, `NEXT_RULES`, `truncateOutput`
- `core/scanner.ts` — project scanning, `getEffectiveRoot()` project root override
- `lsp/client.ts` — LSP JSON-RPC
- `tools/_factory.ts` — tool registration factory
- `vitest.config.ts` — test runner config (suppresses pre-existing stream errors)
- `docs/INSTRUCTION.md` — single source of truth for contracts and conventions

# General Project Rules

## Coding Rules

- Layer boundaries: `core/` must not import from `tools/`, `hooks/`, or `lsp/`. Tools compose core; hooks compose tools.
- Tool registration: Every tool file exports a `register*(pi: ExtensionAPI)` function. The registration happens in `index.ts` default export.
- Output format: All tools return plain text by default, structured JSON when `{ json: true }` is passed. Never mix formats.
- LSP degradation: When LSP server is unavailable, fall back to tree-sitter only. Annotate output with "(tree-sitter only, LSP unavailable)". Never throw on missing LSP.
- Encoding: Always use `core/encoding.ts` adaptive reader (UTF-8 -> GBK -> GB2312). Never assume UTF-8 for source files.
- Tool descriptions: Write clear, specific `description` strings for every registered tool — these are what the LLM reads to decide when to call.
- CI: GitHub Actions runs on push/PR to main. Check CI status before merging. Never skip CI.
- PRs: One vertical slice per PR — build a complete module (core + tool + typecheck), then merge. No big-bang PRs.
- TDD: Write the test first for every slice. Watch it fail, implement, verify, commit.
- AGENTS.md: Update this file whenever a new module, tool, command, or data flow is created.

## Testing Rules

- Type correctness: Run `npm run typecheck` after every change. This is the minimum verification gate.
- Integration testing: Symlink `dist/` into Pi extensions directory and verify tool calls in a live Pi session.
- Test repos: Use `~/.A1/repomap` itself as a test target — it has Python + tree-sitter + LSP scenarios.

## Debugging Rules

- Tree-sitter parse failures: Check grammar version compatibility in `package.json`. Run parse on a single file with verbose logging.
- LSP communication errors: Check `lsp/client.ts` JSON-RPC frame parsing. Common issues: Content-Length mismatch, incomplete reads, server crash on initialize.
- Tool not appearing in Pi: Verify `register*` is called in `index.ts`. Check Pi extension loading logs. Verify the tool name doesn't conflict with existing Pi tools.

## Verification Before Completion

- Every module: `npm run typecheck` passes with zero errors.
- Every tool: callable from Pi, returns non-empty text output on a sample project.
- Every hook: triggers correctly on the appropriate event in a live Pi session.
- Every LSP feature: at least one language server responds correctly to the relevant LSP method.

## Project-Specific Rules

- **LANGUAGE RULE**: All source code, code comments, JSDoc, commit messages, PR titles/descriptions, GitHub Issue content, and GitHub Release notes MUST be written in English. No Chinese or any other non-English language in any artifact that goes into the repository. This is a hard requirement for this project.
- **DEVELOPMENT RULE**: All development and maintenance of this project MUST follow the conventions, workflows, and contracts defined in `docs/INSTRUCTION.md`. This includes Pi extension API contracts, architecture layer boundaries, tool registration patterns, content format contracts, release process, and verification gates. `INSTRUCTION.md` is the single source of truth — read it before making any change.
- **No emoji or decorative symbols.** Emoji, Unicode decorative characters, and ASCII art are forbidden in all source files, tool output, code comments, and commit messages. The only allowed symbols are standard ASCII punctuation and Markdown formatting characters. This rule applies to all repository artifacts except `AGENTS.md` itself (this file) and `SKILL.md`.
- **Tool output must be clean.** Tool output text returned to the LLM must be minimal, structured, and free of noise. Specifically:
  - No emoji, no decorative Unicode, no ANSI escape codes
  - No "friendly" filler phrases — be direct and factual
  - Consistent heading hierarchy (`## tool_name`, `### section`)
  - Numerical data in tables or key-value pairs, not prose
  - Truncation explicitly flagged (`... and N more`)
  - No trailing whitespace, no excessive blank lines
- Pi extension API: Import types from `./types/pi-extension.js` (local stub). Use `ExtensionAPI`, `ExtensionContext`, `AgentToolResult` — do not redefine these types.
- Tool naming: Prefix all tools with `shazam_` to avoid conflicts with other Pi extensions.
- Symbol IDs: Format as `{file}::{name}::{line}` to match the repomap convention. Keep this stable — other tools depend on it.

## Agent Checklist

Before committing or creating a PR, verify ALL of the following:

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes with zero errors
- [ ] `npm test` passes — 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skipped
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.d.ts` present
- [ ] `shazam_verify` called after all code changes (PASS/WARN verdict, no FAIL)
- [ ] Read `docs/INSTRUCTION.md` if any contract, layer, or convention was changed
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated if new module/tool/command/hook/data flow was added
- [ ] MCP tools synced in `mcp/tools.ts` if Pi tools were changed
- [ ] README.md updated if user-facing features or tool list changed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated if this is a release commit
- [ ] All code comments, JSDoc, commit messages in English (no Chinese)
- [ ] Completion report: done -> results -> confirmed -> decisions needed -> follow-up
- [ ] Address user as, default to Chinese, explain in business terms, do not dump code
- [ ] Code comments explain business purpose + implementation logic + edge cases
- [ ] No empty catch blocks — handle or propagate every error
