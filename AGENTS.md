## User System Rules

# Rules

## 1) Prohibitions

- No silent assumptions at critical semantic points.
- No fabricated tool outputs, test results, logs, or external confirmations.
- No hardcoding where constants, enums, or shared definitions are appropriate.
- No blind copy-paste of generated code. Review all generated code, especially queries, auth, file handling, and user input.
- No skipping verification for features, bugfixes, or behavior changes.
- No ignoring security on auth, permissions, secrets, file access, execution, or user input paths.

## 2) Basic Norms

- Address the user as `老板`.
- Default to Simplified Chinese. Use English only for code, commands, technical terms, commit types, and tool names.
- Treat the user as non-technical unless they clearly ask for engineering detail. Explain in business terms first.
- Do not dump code unless the user asks for code.
- Verify important claims with tools. Do not ignore type errors, build errors, failing tests, or command failures.
- Comments added to code must explain: business purpose, implementation logic, and edge cases; use Chinese and avoid jargon.

## 3) Behavioral Guidelines

### 3.1 Before Acting

- State assumptions explicitly when meaning is unclear.
- Propose a simpler path when the requested approach is heavier than necessary.
- When business logic or domain rules are unclear, ask once rather than guess. A wrong assumption costs more than a clarifying question.

### 3.2 Change Discipline

- Do only what the user asked. Prefer the smallest change that solves the request.
- Fix broken things on sight — build errors, missing dependencies, type errors, broken commands — regardless of whether the current task introduced it. Do not touch anything that is a matter of style or opinion (naming, formatting, architecture preference) unless the task explicitly requires it. Report fixes in the completion report.
- Match the local style of the touched area.
- Keep shared business rules, cache keys, and classification logic in one source of truth. When adding state, cache, schema, or persisted fields, update the full lifecycle.

### 3.3 Verifiable Execution

- Verify beyond the happy path: boundary cases, repeated runs, and nearby old entry points.
- Execute autonomously. Do not stop and ask for confirmation between steps — keep going until the task is complete or you hit a blocker.
- Stop and ask only when: (a) verification fails and you cannot fix it, (b) business meaning or domain rules are unclear, (c) a destructive action has no safety net, or (d) the user explicitly asked to be consulted.
- Verification failure: stop immediately, report what failed and why, do not self-patch tests or silently work around the failure.
- If the request is naturally multi-step, list the plan first, then execute all steps autonomously:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

## 4) Completion Report

Trigger only when the task or milestone is fully completed:

```markdown
老板您好，已完成 [一句话总结]。

**做了什么**

- [业务层面]: [通俗说明变更内容和原因]

**结果**

- [什么变了]: [用户视角描述变更效果]
- [影响范围]: [受影响的页面/功能/模块]

**已确认**

- [验证项 1]: [验证方式和结果]
- [验证项 2]: [验证方式和结果]

**需要你决策**

- [需人工判断的事项]: [为什么需要你决定]

**待跟进**

- #N: [简述] → 已建 issue，后续处理
```

## 5) Tool Invocation — Aggressive & Automatic

Skills and MCP tools provide domain-specific knowledge and workflows. When a relevant skill or MCP tool exists for the task at hand, invoke it without asking — do not default to raw shell commands when a better alternative is available.

## 6) Coding Structure Rules

### 6.1 Function Scope

- A function does ONE thing. If its name needs "and" to describe its purpose, split it.
- If a function exceeds 80 lines, extract helper functions (`_build_*`, `_compute_*`, `_classify_*`).

### 6.2 File Boundaries

- One file = one business concept. A file named `utils.py` or `helpers.ts` over 200 lines is no longer utilities — split it by domain.
- When a single file contains 2+ unrelated domains, extract each into its own file under a shared directory.
- When migrating: grep all callers first, update them, then delete the old file. Do not create pass-through compatibility layers.

### 6.3 Deletion Discipline

- When a component, function, or module is replaced, delete the old one in the same change. No compatibility wrappers.
- Before deleting, grep for all references. If any remain, update them in the same change.
- A file that only re-exports another module's symbols is dead weight — inline the imports at call sites and remove the file.

### 6.4 API Calls

- Before writing any `fetch()`, `axios.`, `curl`, or API client code, read `./api.d.ts` if it exists. The endpoint path, HTTP method, request shape, and response shape must match `api.d.ts` exactly.
- When implementing a new API call, cross-check: does the backend endpoint exist in `api.d.ts`? Does the frontend request shape match the backend's expected input?
- External library APIs → query `context7` MCP. Your project's own API → read `./api.d.ts`. Know which is which — do not guess either.
- If the needed endpoint is not in `api.d.ts`, update `api.d.ts` FIRST, then implement both backend and frontend. Never write client code against an undocumented endpoint.

### 6.5 Logging

- Every `except` / `catch` / `match Err` branch must either handle the error (with a log) or propagate it. Empty catch blocks are forbidden.
- When handling an error, log: what operation failed, the input context, and the original error message.

## 7) Reasoning

Reasoning effort is set to xhigh. Please think carefully through the task, validate key assumptions, consider plausible alternatives, and prioritize correctness, consistency, and clarity in the final answer.

## 8) Toolchain Rules

- Python: ALL operations MUST go through `uv` — installing, running, syncing, building. NEVER invoke `python`, `pip`, `venv`, or `virtualenv` directly. If a command needs Python, wrap it with `uv run`. If dependencies need installing, use `uv sync`. If a virtual environment is needed, `uv` manages it automatically.

## 9) Open Source Issue Reply Guidelines

pi-shazam is an open-source project. When replying to issues filed by external (non-owner) users:

- **Tone**: Warm, appreciative, and welcoming. This is someone giving us free time and feedback — treat them as a valued contributor, not a ticket number.
- **Language**: Reply in English (open-source convention). Use the user's name or GitHub handle.
- **Structure**: Acknowledge the issue → state what was done → mention the fix version → thank them.
- **For bug reports**: Thank them for finding it, confirm the root cause briefly, link the fixing PR, mention the version it will ship in.
- **For feature requests**: Thank them for the idea, explain whether/how it will be implemented, mention any known limitations (e.g., dependency constraints).
- **Never**: Be dismissive, blame the user, leave an issue unacknowledged for more than 48 hours, or close without explanation.
- **Template for bug fix**:

  ```
  Hi @{user}, thank you for reporting this!

  Root cause: [brief explanation]

  Fixed in PR #{pr_number}, shipped in v{version}.
  Please upgrade: `pi install npm:pi-shazam@latest`

  Feel free to reopen if you still see the issue after updating.
  ```

- **Template for feature request**:

  ```
  Hi @{user}, great suggestion!

  Implemented in PR #{pr_number}, shipping in v{version}.

  Known limitation: [if any, explain briefly]
  Full support will be available when [condition, e.g., dependency upgrades].

  Thanks for helping us improve!
  ```

# pi-shazam

Pi coding agent native codebase awareness extension. "Shazam" — like the superhero whose power comes from multiple deities, pi-shazam unifies the strength of multiple analysis engines (repomap/aider, pi-lens, serena MCP, tree-sitter, LSP) into one coherent interface for the agent.

Rewrites the Python CLI project [repomap](https://github.com/gjczone/repomap) as a native Pi extension in TypeScript. All analysis capabilities register as first-class Pi tools — LLM sees them alongside `read`/`write`/`bash` with no distinction.

## Development Environment

- Node.js ≥18, npm as package manager
- `types/pi-extension.d.ts` provides self-contained `ExtensionAPI` type stub (extracted from Pi coding agent runtime at `~/.pi/`, scope `@earendil-works/pi-*`)
- `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` required due to tree-sitter grammar peer dependency conflicts
- `tree-sitter@^0.22.4` pinned via `overrides` in package.json
- `vscode-languageserver-protocol` for LSP type definitions
- `iconv-lite` for UTF-8/GBK/GB2312 encoding fallback
- Test the extension by symlinking `dist/` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-shazam` or configuring in Pi settings

## Dependency API Reference (context7 verified 2026-06)

### tree-sitter (node-tree-sitter v0.22.4)

- **Parser**: `import Parser from "tree-sitter"` → `new Parser()` → `parser.setLanguage(new Language(grammarModule))`
- **Parsing**: `parser.parse(sourceString)` returns `Tree`; `tree.rootNode` for root `SyntaxNode`
- **Query**: `new Query(language, queryString)` → `query.captures(node)` returns `{name: string, node: SyntaxNode}[]`
- **No QueryCursor**: Node.js binding does not have Python's `QueryCursor` class, use `query.captures()` directly
- **Node properties**: `node.type`, `node.text`, `node.children`, `node.parent`, `node.previousSibling`, `node.startPosition`/`endPosition` (`.row`/`.column`), `node.childForFieldName("name")`
- **Grammar loading**: `new Language(grammarModule)` wraps native module, not Python's `Language(fn())` constructor pattern
- **Input type**: `parse()` accepts `string` or callback `(index, position) => string | null`, not Buffer
- **No built-in .d.ts**: Need to declare types manually or use `@types/tree-sitter`

### vscode-languageserver-protocol (v3.18.0) + vscode-jsonrpc (v9.0.0)

- **Protocol types**: Import `Diagnostic`, `Location`, `Position`, `Range`, `SymbolKind`, `InitializeParams`, `InitializeResult`, `TextDocumentItem`, `DidOpenTextDocumentParams`, `ReferenceContext` etc. from `vscode-languageserver-protocol`
- **LSP client communication**: Use `vscode-jsonrpc/node`'s `StreamMessageReader` / `StreamMessageWriter` + `createMessageConnection` instead of hand-written Content-Length frame parsing. This is the officially recommended client pattern, and `vscode-jsonrpc@9.0.0` is already a transitive dependency
- **Usage example**: `import * as rpc from "vscode-jsonrpc/node"` → `rpc.createMessageConnection(new rpc.StreamMessageReader(child.stdout), new rpc.StreamMessageWriter(child.stdin))` → `connection.sendRequest(method, params)` / `connection.onNotification(type, handler)`
- **Do not use createConnection**: `createConnection` is a server-side API (for building language servers), this project is a client and does not need it

## Architecture

4 layers: `hooks/` → `tools/` → `core/` + `lsp/`. `core/` has zero Pi or LSP imports. Tools compose core and enrich with LSP data. Hooks call tool logic and inject into LLM context.

### Layer dependency direction

`hooks/` → `tools/` → `core/` + `lsp/`. The `core/` layer has zero Pi or LSP imports. Tools compose core functions and optionally enrich with LSP data. Hooks call tool logic directly and inject results into LLM context via `pi.sendMessage()`.

## Change Map

- **Adding a new tool**: Create `tools/<name>.ts` with `register*` function using `createTool(pi, { name, label, description, params, execute })` from `tools/_factory.ts` → import and call in `index.ts` → the factory auto-handles json/maxTokens params, scanProject, content envelope, and truncation → for complex async tools, use `customExecute` instead of `execute` → append Next recommendation rules to `NEXT_RULES` in `core/output.ts` (no switch to edit) → choose one of 5 description styles: Prerequisite, Scenario trigger, Consequence hint, Action binding, or Anti-pattern warning → sync the tool table in `AGENTS.md`, add full docs to `SKILL.md`, and update `README.md` if user-facing tool list changed
- **Adding a Next recommendation**: Append a `NextRule` object to `NEXT_RULES` in `core/output.ts`. Each rule: `{ forTools, condition(ctx, graph?), recommendation(ctx) }`. Rules evaluate against context + optional RepoGraph (for graph-aware filters like `hasTestFiles`, `hasHierarchyKinds`).
- **Adding a new language**: Add grammar to `core/treesitter.ts` EXT_TO_LANG map → add tree-sitter query in `core/treesitter-queries.ts` → add LSP server config in `lsp/servers.ts`
- **Changing graph algorithm**: Modify `core/pagerank.ts` or `core/graph.ts` → verify all tools that consume `RepoGraph` still produce correct output
- **Changing LSP protocol**: Modify `lsp/client.ts` → verify `lsp/manager.ts` lifecycle still works → test with at least 2 different language servers
- **Changing tool output format**: Update the specific `tools/*.ts` formatter → verify JSON envelope schema
- **Adding a new hook**: Create `hooks/<name>.ts` with a `register*` function that calls `pi.on(...)` → import and call in `index.ts` default export. Hooks subscribe to lifecycle events (`tool_execution_start`, `before_agent_start`, etc.) and do not return tools to the LLM. Add to hooks/ tree in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Adding a tool (MCP sync) [CRITICAL]**: After adding/changing/deleting a Pi tool → add/update/remove the matching `registerTool` in `mcp/tools.ts` → update `mcp/README.md` tool table → sync Pi tool description changes to MCP tool descriptions. MCP and Pi tools MUST stay in sync in the same PR. **Important**: MCP tools have SEPARATE definitions (using Zod) from Pi tools (using TypeBox). When changing:
  - Tool name: update `server.registerTool("shazam_*", ...)` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Tool description: update `description: "..."` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Tool parameters: update `inputSchema: z.object({...})` in mcp/tools.ts
  - Update `README.md` if user-facing tool list or usage changed
  - Run `./scripts/release.sh` to ensure everything is synced and deployed

## First Places to Inspect

Key entry points — shazam_overview "Suggested Reading Order" provides the full list:

- `index.ts` — extension entry, all registrations
- `core/treesitter.ts` — language support, symbol extraction
- `core/graph.ts` — dependency graph
- `lsp/client.ts` — LSP JSON-RPC
- `tools/_factory.ts` — tool registration factory
- `docs/INSTRUCTION.md` — single source of truth for contracts and conventions

# General Project Rules

## Coding Rules

- Layer boundaries: `core/` must not import from `tools/`, `hooks/`, or `lsp/`. Tools compose core; hooks compose tools.
- Tool registration: Every tool file exports a `register*(pi: ExtensionAPI)` function. The registration happens in `index.ts` default export.
- Output format: All tools return plain text by default, structured JSON when `{ json: true }` is passed. Never mix formats.
- LSP degradation: When LSP server is unavailable, fall back to tree-sitter only. Annotate output with "(tree-sitter only, LSP unavailable)". Never throw on missing LSP.
- Encoding: Always use `core/encoding.ts` adaptive reader (UTF-8 → GBK → GB2312). Never assume UTF-8 for source files.
- Tool descriptions: Write clear, specific `description` strings for every registered tool — these are what the LLM reads to decide when to call.
- CI: GitHub Actions runs on push/PR to main. Check CI status before merging. Never skip CI.
- PRs: One vertical slice per PR — build a complete module (core + tool + typecheck), then merge. No big-bang PRs.
- TDD: Write the test first for every slice. Watch it fail, implement, verify, commit.
- AGENTS.md: Update this file whenever a new module, tool, command, or data flow is created.

## Testing Rules

- Type correctness: Run `npm run typecheck` after every change. This is the minimum verification gate.
- Integration testing: Symlink `dist/` into Pi extensions directory and verify tool calls in a live Pi session.
- Test repos: Use `~/.A1/repomap` itself as a test target — it has Python + tree-sitter + LSP scenarios.

## Debugging Rules

- Tree-sitter parse failures: Check grammar version compatibility in `package.json`. Run parse on a single file with verbose logging.
- LSP communication errors: Check `lsp/client.ts` JSON-RPC frame parsing. Common issues: Content-Length mismatch, incomplete reads, server crash on initialize.
- Tool not appearing in Pi: Verify `register*` is called in `index.ts`. Check Pi extension loading logs. Verify the tool name doesn't conflict with existing Pi tools.

## Verification Before Completion

- Every module: `npm run typecheck` passes with zero errors.
- Every tool: callable from Pi, returns non-empty text output on a sample project.
- Every hook: triggers correctly on the appropriate event in a live Pi session.
- Every LSP feature: at least one language server responds correctly to the relevant LSP method.

## Project-Specific Rules

- **LANGUAGE RULE**: All source code, code comments, JSDoc, commit messages, PR titles/descriptions, GitHub Issue content, and GitHub Release notes MUST be written in English. No Chinese or any other non-English language in any artifact that goes into the repository. This is a hard requirement for this project.
- **DEVELOPMENT RULE**: All development and maintenance of this project MUST follow the conventions, workflows, and contracts defined in `docs/INSTRUCTION.md`. This includes Pi extension API contracts, architecture layer boundaries, tool registration patterns, content format contracts, release process, and verification gates. `INSTRUCTION.md` is the single source of truth — read it before making any change.
- **No emoji or decorative symbols.** Emoji (✅❌🔴🟡🟢🆕⚠️💡 etc.), Unicode decorative characters, and ASCII art are forbidden in all source files, tool output, code comments, and commit messages. The only allowed symbols are standard ASCII punctuation and Markdown formatting characters. This rule applies to all repository artifacts except `AGENTS.md` itself (this file) and `SKILL.md`.
- **Tool output must be clean.** Tool output text returned to the LLM must be minimal, structured, and free of noise. Specifically:
  - No emoji, no decorative Unicode, no ANSI escape codes
  - No "friendly" filler phrases — be direct and factual
  - Consistent heading hierarchy (`## tool_name`, `### section`)
  - Numerical data in tables or key-value pairs, not prose
  - Truncation explicitly flagged (`... and N more`)
  - No trailing whitespace, no excessive blank lines
- Pi extension API: Import types from `./types/pi-extension.js` (local stub). Use `ExtensionAPI`, `ExtensionContext`, `AgentToolResult` — do not redefine these types.
- Tool naming: Prefix all tools with `shazam_` to avoid conflicts with other Pi extensions.
- Symbol IDs: Format as `{file}::{name}::{line}` to match the repomap convention. Keep this stable — other tools depend on it.
