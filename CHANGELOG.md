and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-28

### Features

- **feat: auto-run LSP setup report and auto-install git pre-commit hook on session start** -- `/shazam-setup` and `/shazam-install-git-hooks` now run automatically on `session_start`, eliminating the need for manual commands. Users get LSP server availability reports and git pre-commit hooks configured out of the box. All commands remain registered for manual re-run.

### Documentation

- **docs: restructure README Installation section** -- clearly separates _Native Extension (Pi only)_ and _MCP Server (all other agents)_ with one-line descriptions under each heading for instant recognition. Kimi Code moved to MCP section.
- **docs: add When column to Slash Commands table** -- distinguishes setup, diagnostic, and automatic commands at a glance.
- **docs: add per-platform MCP config examples** -- CodeBuddy, Kimi Code, Qwen Code, Claude, Codex, Qoder, Trae config snippets in README and MCP README.
- **docs: remove Contributing section and move MCP JSON config into README Installation section** -- streamlined user-facing documentation.

### Chore

- **chore: re-run project-init** -- regenerated AGENTS.md, README.md, rules/, and scripts/ from latest project-init skill.
- **style: fix prettier formatting in mcp/entry.ts**

## [0.19.9] - 2026-06-26

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#486): MCP server ignores project root when launched without CLI argument** -- added fallback chain for PROJECT_ROOT resolution: CLI arg > `PI_SHAZAM_PROJECT_ROOT` env > `PWD` env > `.` (cwd). This fixes the issue where MCP clients (ZCode, Cursor, etc.) that don't pass project root as a CLI argument would use the wrong working directory, causing "No matching source files found" errors.

## [0.19.8] - 2026-06-26

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#485): MCP server fails to start when entry.js is accessed via symlink** -- npm/npx always create symlinks in `.bin/` directories. The `isMainModule` guard compared `process.argv[1]` (symlink path) against `import.meta.url` (resolved file URL), which never matched, preventing `main()` from ever executing. Fixed by using `realpathSync()` for symlink-safe path comparison. Also fixed `package.json` version resolution to search upward from both `dist/mcp/` (compiled) and `mcp/` (vitest source) contexts.

## [0.19.7] - 2026-06-26

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#462): wrap readFileSync in try/catch to prevent TOCTOU races in git-hooks** -- `core/git-hooks.ts` now catches exceptions from `readFileSync` when reading git hook files, preventing race conditions when hooks are deleted between detection and reading.
- **fix(#463): use relative()-based path containment for Windows** -- replaced `startsWith` path containment checks with `path.relative()`-based logic in hooks, fixing false negatives on Windows where drive letters and mixed separators caused incorrect containment results.
- **fix(#464): use getEffectiveRoot() instead of process.cwd() in factory and MCP** -- `tools/_factory.ts` and `mcp/entry.ts` now use the explicit project root override via `getEffectiveRoot()` instead of `process.cwd()`, ensuring consistent project root resolution when MCP or factory-injected params specify a different root.
- **fix(#465): close MCP shazam_format path-traversal and home-only startup** -- replaced the hard `$HOME` prefix restriction in MCP `validateProjectRoot` with an existence + directory check that accepts any valid directory (containers, CI under `/workspace`, `/srv`, `/opt`). Opt-in `PI_SHAZAM_HOME_ONLY=1` environment variable restores the old restriction for hardened environments. Added `pathToFileURL` guard so `mcp/entry.ts` only runs `main()` when executed as entry point.
- **fix(#466): uriToPath drive-letter handling + detectWorkspaceRoot escape** -- `lsp/client.ts` `uriToPath` now delegates to Node.js `fileURLToPath` for proper drive-letter URI handling (`file:///C:/...`), with a fallback to manual slice+decode for malformed URIs. `lsp/manager.ts` `detectWorkspaceRoot` now validates the result is within the project root to prevent escape.
- **fix(#467): close 4 pre-commit and safety gate bypass paths** -- closed bypass paths in `hooks/safety.ts` (chained commands after git commit, download-then-execute RCE patterns), `hooks/stop-verify.ts` (reset `_reminderSent` on verify error), `hooks/verify-state.ts` (FAIL verdict text parsing for non-JSON verify output), and `hooks/shazam-guide.ts` (path normalization).
- **fix(#468): route assessRisk by explicit mode instead of orphanDelta** -- `core/risk.ts` now routes risk assessment by explicit mode parameter instead of relying on `orphanDelta` heuristics, preventing incorrect risk classification when orphan counts happen to match threshold values.
- **fix(#469): replace O(NxM) dependent detection and nameIndex cleanup with reverse-index lookups** -- `core/scanner.ts` incremental scan now uses reverse-index lookups instead of O(N\*M) iteration for dependent detection and nameIndex cleanup, significantly improving performance on large codebases.
- **fix(#470): honor maxTokens in format/rename_symbol customExecute and verify JSON mode** -- `tools/format.ts` and `tools/rename_symbol.ts` customExecute paths now honor `maxTokens` parameter with `truncateOutput`, matching the factory auto-truncation behavior. JSON mode is left intact to preserve valid JSON structure.
- **fix(#471): core data integrity - MAX_FILES warn, cache null guards, targetToSources source cleanup** -- added MAX_FILES warning in scanner when file count exceeds threshold, null guards in `core/cache.ts` for corrupt cache entries, and proper source cleanup in `core/graph.ts` `targetToSources` to prevent stale references.
- **fix(#472): guard optional event.input before cast in agent-context-guard** -- `hooks/agent-context-guard.ts` now guards `event.input` with optional chaining before casting, preventing runtime errors when the event object lacks the `input` property.

### Refactoring

- **refactor(#461): standardize console.warn to \_logWarn across codebase** -- replaced all `console.warn` calls with the shared `_logWarn` function from `core/output.ts` across 16 files, ensuring consistent warning format, ENOENT suppression, and centralized log control.

### Tests

- **test(#461): 8 new test files added** -- `tests/path-containment.test.ts`, `tests/risk.test.ts`, `tests/stop-verify.test.ts`, `tests/lsp-uri-workspace.test.ts`, `tests/git-hooks-toctou.test.ts`, `tests/scanner-perf.test.ts`, `tests/maxtokens-truncation.test.ts`, `tests/data-integrity.test.ts` -- covering all bug fixes in this release with 52 test files and 601 total tests.

## [0.19.6] - 2026-06-25

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#459): suppress ENOENT warnings from readFileAdaptive for missing config files** -- added `existsSync` guards before reading `package.json` in `core/formatters.ts` and `tools/overview.ts`, suppressed ENOENT `console.warn` in `core/encoding.ts` for both sync and async variants, and wrapped `readFileAdaptive` in try/catch in `hooks/shazam-guide.ts`. Non-Node.js projects (Rust, Python, Go) no longer see noisy ENOENT warnings on startup.

### Tests

- **test(#459): ENOENT warning suppression test** -- added test to `tests/formatters.test.ts` verifying that `detectFormatters` does not emit `console.warn` with ENOENT/stat-failed messages when called on a directory without `package.json`.

## [0.19.5] - 2026-06-25

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#457): JSON LSP executable name mismatch** -- `lsp/servers.ts` now searches for the binary name `vscode-json-language-server` (hyphenated), which is what the recommended package `vscode-langservers-extracted` actually installs. The legacy alias `vscode-json-languageserver` (no hyphen) is kept as a fallback for users with the alternative npm package. The previous lookup name matched a binary that ships from a different npm package, causing `LSP server executable not found` after following the install instructions.

### Tests

- **test(#457): regression test for install-instruction vs commandName parity** -- added `tests/lsp-commandnames-parity.test.ts` which fails if any install hint in `lsp/setup.ts` recommends a package whose shipped binary is not listed in the corresponding LSP spec's `commandNames`. Covers JSON, TypeScript, Python, Go, YAML, Rust, Dart.
- **test(#457): JSON spec must include both executable names** -- added a targeted case to `tests/lsp-servers.test.ts` asserting the JSON spec lists both `vscode-json-language-server` and `vscode-json-languageserver`.

## [0.19.4] - 2026-06-25

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#445,#446,#447,#452): MCP path-traversal guards, recordCallChain, projectRoot** -- added path-traversal protections in MCP tools, fixed `recordCallChain` logic, and corrected `projectRoot` handling.
- **fix(#449,#450,#451): LSP URI mismatch, isPathInRoot, \_cleanedUp latch** -- resolved LSP URI mismatch issues, fixed `isPathInRoot` boundary checks, and corrected the `_cleanedUp` latch race condition.
- **fix(#448,#453): incremental scan edge loss + batch P1 cleanup** -- fixed edge loss during incremental scans and implemented batch P1 cleanup improvements.

### Documentation

- **docs**: update LLM-REVIEW-GUIDE.md with fix notes for #448, #451, #445-#447, #452

## [0.19.3] - 2026-06-24

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#444): orphan false positives when same-file references are at module top level** -- `findOrphans` now checks `graph.fileCalls` and `graph.fileRefs` as a fallback when a symbol has zero incoming edges. Top-level calls outside any function body (e.g., module initialization code) produce no symbol-level edge because `findCallerSymbols` returns empty when no enclosing symbol's range covers the call line. The fallback check matches the symbol's name against its own file's call/ref lists, preventing false-positive orphan reports for functions genuinely used within the same file.

### Features & Enhancements

- **enhance(#443): LSP server discovery expanded to mise, asdf, pyenv, pnpm, n, and Homebrew on Linux** -- environment-variable-driven paths (`MISE_DATA_DIR`, `ASDF_DATA_DIR`, `PYENV_ROOT`, `PNPM_HOME`, `N_PREFIX`, `HOMEBREW_PREFIX`) and default fallback directories (`~/.local/share/mise/shims`, `~/.asdf/shims`, `~/.pyenv/shims`, `~/.local/share/pnpm`, `~/.linuxbrew/bin`) are now checked for LSP server executables, enabling automatic detection for users managing runtimes through these version managers.

### Documentation

- **docs**: update model list and add MCP+hooks usage guide

### Other

- **fix**: release.sh Step 8.5 now detects squash-merged branches via `gh pr list` in addition to `git branch --merged`

## [0.19.2] - 2026-06-24

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#441): extension fails to load when vscode-jsonrpc/node is missing** -- wrapped top-level `_require("vscode-jsonrpc/node")` calls in `lsp/client.ts` and `tools/lsp_enrich.ts` in try-catch blocks. When the module is unavailable, the extension loads successfully with LSP disabled and all tree-sitter tools work normally, instead of the entire extension failing to load with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-06-24

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#435): stale ref edges after incremental scan** -- `removeEdgesForFile` and `removeFileData` now clear `fileRefs` alongside `fileImports`/`fileCalls`/`fileImportBindings`, preventing phantom ref edges from surviving incremental scan and disk cache reload
- **fix(#436): phantom extensionless import paths break incremental detection** -- `resolveImport` now returns `null` instead of the first extensionless candidate when no matching file is found on disk; callers filter nulls in `fileImports` and skip edge creation for unresolved imports, fixing the case where creating a new file that resolves a previously-broken import was not detected by incremental scan
- **fix(#437): LSP server process leak from TOCTOU race** -- added a second `_shuttingDown` check after `servers.set()` in `_initServerForLanguage`; if `shutdown()` raced between the first check and server registration, the server is now immediately closed instead of leaking as an orphaned OS process
- **fix(#438): GBK files with >64KB ASCII prefix misdetected as UTF-8** -- for files larger than 64KB where the first chunk passes UTF-8 validation, the full decoded buffer is now checked for replacement character ratio; if >5%, the full buffer is decoded with GBK then GB2312 as fallback, fixing mojibake for Chinese source files with long English preambles
- **fix(#439): cache directory creation failure crashes entire scan** -- `getProjectCacheDir` `mkdirSync` is now wrapped in try/catch; when the cache directory is inaccessible (EACCES, EROFS, ENOSPC), a warning is logged and the scan continues without caching instead of failing all shazam tools
- **fix: LSP \_openingFiles not cleared on \_doClose** -- `_doClose` now clears `_openingFiles` set alongside other state cleanup, preventing stale open-file tracking after LSP server shutdown

### Documentation

- **LLM-REVIEW-GUIDE.md**: created project-specific code review rules, risk tiers (P0/P1/P2/P3), and sanity checks for pi-shazam code reviews

## [0.19.0] - 2026-06-24

### Features & Enhancements

- **enhance(#430): cross-language import resolution** -- import paths are now resolved for Python (dotted + relative + src/ layout), Rust (`mod`, `crate::`, `super::`), Go (relative + directory packages), and Dart (`package:` + relative) in addition to JS/TS, building more complete dependency edges in multi-language projects
- **enhance(#430): existsSync hot-path cache** -- import resolution builds an in-memory `existsSync` cache per scan, eliminating thousands of redundant syscalls during graph construction on large projects
- **enhance(#428): module-level TreeSitterAdapter singleton** -- scanner now reuses a single `TreeSitterAdapter` across scans instead of creating a new instance (which reloads all WASM grammars) on every `scanProject()` call, cutting first-tool latency after startup
- **enhance(#429): fast root-marker language detection** -- `detectProjectLanguages()` now checks root markers (`pubspec.yaml`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`) before walking the directory tree, and raised `maxFiles` default from 2000 to 5000 to reduce language misses on large projects
- **enhance(#429): Dart LSP setup guidance** -- added Dart SDK install instructions to `lsp/setup.ts` so users get actionable setup steps instead of "server not found"
- **enhance(#431): improved Dart grammar failure message** -- when Dart tree-sitter grammar fails to load (due to tree-sitter 0.22/0.24 ABI mismatch), the error message now explains that LSP features still work and tree-sitter parsing requires an upgrade

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#428-C1): Parser instance sharing corrupts concurrent parse state** -- TypeScript and TSX fallback paths now create independent `Parser` instances wrapping the JavaScript language instead of storing the same JS parser reference under three keys; concurrent `parse()` calls on a shared instance mutated internal WASM state and produced corrupt trees
- **fix(#428-C2): per-scan TreeSitterAdapter reloads WASM grammars** -- scanner now holds a module-level lazy singleton (`_scannerAdapter`) instead of constructing a fresh `TreeSitterAdapter` on every scan, eliminating redundant WASM compilation and reducing memory churn
- **fix(#428-C3): CancellationToken listener leak in LSP client** -- `_sendRequest` now saves the `onCancellationRequested` listener disposable and releases it in `finally`; previously listeners accumulated on every request and were never disposed, causing a slow memory leak on long-running Pi sessions
- **fix(#429): Windows path URI double-encodes drive letter colon** -- `pathToUri()` now detects Windows drive letters (`C:`) and preserves the colon instead of encoding it as `%3A`, which caused LSP servers to reject file URIs on Windows
- **fix(#429): lspLanguageId misclassifies .js/.mjs/.cjs as TypeScript** -- removed over-broad suffix mapping that sent JS files with TypeScript language ID; now only `.tsx` maps to `typescriptreact` and `.jsx` to `javascriptreact`
- **fix(#429): collectDiagnostics iterates all notifications on every call** -- replaced O(n) iteration over `_notifications` map with direct lookup by requested file URI; only consumes diagnostics for files the caller asked about
- **fix(#429): LSP initialize not cancellable** -- `initialize()` now links the caller's `AbortSignal` to an internal `CancellationTokenSource` so init can be properly cancelled on shutdown
- **fix(#429): \_openingFiles not cleared on crash cleanup** -- `_cleanupAfterCrash()` now clears `_openingFiles` set alongside `_openedFiles`, preventing leaked open-file state after LSP crash recovery
- **fix(#429): empty catch blocks swallow errors in LSP timeout/cleanup paths** -- replaced silent `catch {}` blocks in `withTimeout` and `_cleanupAfterCrash` with `_log()` calls that surface the actual error message
- **fix(#429): Dart LSP serverName mismatch** -- corrected `serverName` from `"dart-language-server"` to `"dart"` to match the actual binary name; the mismatch caused server discovery to skip the Dart SDK binary even when installed
- **fix(#429): detectProjectLanguages uses resolve() not realpathSync() for cycle detection** -- switched to `realpathSync()` so symlinked directories are properly deduplicated; switched remaining `console.warn` calls to `_logWarn` for consistent logging
- **fix(#431): Rust \_isExported over-scopes visibility_modifier check** -- `pub` visibility is now checked only on the immediate node's children instead of all ancestors; previously a `pub` field inside a private struct caused the entire parent chain to be incorrectly marked as exported
- **fix(#431): Rust import query captures scoped_use_list wrapper node** -- removed `(scoped_use_list)` capture from Rust import query so imports like `use foo::{bar, baz}` capture individual identifiers instead of the braced list as a single string
- **fix(#431): Dart tree-sitter queries use @sengac/tree-sitter-dart node types** -- updated Dart import query to match `configurable_uri > uri > string_literal`, and call query to match `constructor_invocation` and `new_expression` nodes instead of the old `method_invocation` pattern that produced zero captures

### Refactoring

- Scanner singleton reset is now wired into `resetCache()` for test isolation

## [0.18.2] - 2026-06-23

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#421): customExecute tools use process.cwd() instead of scanner project root override** — exported `getEffectiveRoot()` from scanner; replaced `process.cwd()` in customExecute tools (lookup, verify, rename_symbol) with the overridable root so path validation and JSON envelope metadata work correctly when Pi detects the project in a subdirectory; fixed misleading factory comment
- **fix(#424): orphan false positives for module-level infrastructure symbols** — added `isInfrastructureWrapper()` filter to `findOrphans()` that skips `_require` (ESM/CJS interop), `__filename`, and `__dirname` from orphan detection; these are live code at module top level but invisible to the dependency graph because their usage is in top-level expressions
- **fix(#425): console.warn/error stack trace noise** — added shared `_logWarn()` helper to `core/output.ts` that suppresses ENOENT errors and prints concise one-line warnings instead of full stack traces; replaced 41 `console.warn/error(err)` calls across 15 files so expected degradation (LSP unavailable, config missing) no longer looks like a crash
- **fix(#426): LSP detection misses version manager binaries (nvm/fnm/volta)** — added `_getVersionManagerBinDirs()` helper that dynamically resolves bin directories from `NVM_BIN`, `FNM_MULTISHELL_PATH`, `FNM_DIR`, and `VOLTA_HOME` environment variables; wired into both `SAFE_PATH_DIRS` and `trustedUserCandidates()` so globally installed LSP servers are correctly discovered

## [0.18.1] - 2026-06-23

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#416): hooks noise reduction** — shazam-guide.ts no longer suggests `shazam_format` when no formatter is configured in the project; skips the "run shazam_verify first" tip when a recent PASS verify already exists; pre-edit.ts deduplicates warned file groups to avoid repeated impact notifications
- **fix(#417): hooks auto-verify and global config awareness** — stop-verify.ts injects a steer message with `triggerTurn: true` at turn_end for unverified edits, forcing the agent to run `shazam_verify` before continuing; pre-edit.ts triggers impact warnings for single-file edits of global config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- **fix(#418): pi-shazam native hooks parity improvements** — TypeScript hooks now match kimi-code hook behavior for noise reduction, auto-verify, and global config detection
- **chore(#419): cleanup** — renamed misleading "emoji" variable to "levelTag" in safety.ts

### Documentation

- Updated README.md with GLM-5.2 and GLM-5.1 models in vibe coding table
- Synced kimi-code hooks documentation: updated version mapping, hooks config table, parity table, and maintenance checklist; added smoke test (15 cases, 9 tool dimensions)

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-23

### Security

- **fix(#413-C4): file symlink path traversal (reading outside project root)** — resolved symlink realpath is now validated to be within project root before adding to files array; malicious symlinks like `src/evil.ts -> /etc/shadow` are now skipped with a warning
- **fix(#413-M8): missing path validation in impact and find_tests tools** — added `validatePathInProject` checks for user-supplied file path parameters in `shazam_impact` and `shazam_find_tests` as defense-in-depth
- **fix(#413-M9): MCP path validation uses process.cwd() not configured projectRoot** — MCP `registerAllTools` now accepts `projectRoot` parameter and uses it consistently for all path validations
- **fix(#413-M10): predictable temp file name in rename_symbol atomicWriteFile** — replaced `filePath + ".tmp." + process.pid` with `crypto.randomUUID()` based filename to prevent symlink attacks on multi-user systems

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#413-C1): file symlinks silently skipped in directory walk** — fixed the `else if` chain fall-through bug; file symlinks are now properly detected and treated as regular files after validating their target is within project root
- **fix(#413-C2): LSP server process leak — concurrent shutdown + init race** — added `_shuttingDown` check inside `_initServerForLanguage` right before `this.servers.set()`; if shutdown was triggered during init, the client is closed immediately instead of leaking the process
- **fix(#413-C3): scanner and LSP use different project roots** — scanner now uses `_projectRootOverride` when caller passes `"."` (default path), ensuring tree-sitter analysis and LSP analysis run on the same directory when Pi detects the project in a subdirectory
- **fix(#413-H1): ref edges lost after disk cache load + incremental scan** — added `fileRefs` to `SerializedGraphV2`; refs are now serialized and restored from disk cache, fixing the silent loss of same-file ref edges after the first incremental scan following a cache load
- **fix(#413-H2): LSP crash recovery re-reads files with UTF-8 only (encoding bypass)** — replaced `readFileAsync(absPath, "utf-8")` with `readFileAdaptiveAsync` for the crash recovery re-open path
- **fix(#413-H3): encoding blindness — 15+ call sites bypass readFileAdaptive** — replaced all project-file reads with `readFileAdaptive` / `readFileAdaptiveAsync` across `tools/overview.ts`, `tools/find_tests.ts`, `tools/format.ts`, `core/formatters.ts`, `core/git-hooks.ts`, and `hooks/shazam-guide.ts`
- **fix(#413-H4): Python **all** triple-quoted strings not stripped correctly** — updated regex to handle 1-3 quotes (`['"]{1,3}`) on both ends; triple-quoted strings like `'''foo'''` now correctly match real symbols
- **fix(#413-H5): TreeSitter \_within() uses strict inequality — boundary symbols missed** — changed strict `>`/`<` to `>=`/`<=` for start/end position comparison; symbols starting at exactly the same row+column as the definition node are now correctly considered "within"
- **fix(#413-H6): deserialized graph may have dangling edges** — `deserializeGraphV2` now skips edges where source or target symbol IDs don't exist in `graph.symbols`, logging a warning for each skipped edge to prevent crashes in downstream code
- **fix(#413-M2): saveGraphCache has no size limit — OOM risk for huge projects** — added 20MB size limit check on save (matching the load-side limit); `JSON.stringify` result is checked before writing, and cache is skipped with a warning if too large
- **fix(#413-M3): \_cleanupAfterCrash called twice (error + exit events)** — added `_cleanedUp` flag that `_cleanupAfterCrash` checks and sets on first entry, separate from `_closing` which is for intentional shutdown only
- **fix(#413-M4): import line numbers lost after cache deserialization** — `fileImports` now serialized as `[string, number][]` tuples to preserve line numbers instead of flattening to `string[]`
- **fix(#413-M5): compareGraphSnapshots edge diff ignores weight and confidence changes** — edge identity now includes weight and confidence (`${source}::${target}::${kind}::${weight}::${confidence}`), so modified edges are detected not just added/removed ones
- **fix(#413-M6): error object discarded in multiple catch blocks** — all catch blocks in `tools/lookup.ts` and `tools/verify.ts` now capture and log the actual error object instead of just a fixed-string warning
- **fix(#413-M7): fire-and-forget audit log promise with empty catch** — replaced `_writePromise.catch(() => {})` with proper error logging so unexpected errors from `redact()` or `JSON.stringify()` are surfaced
- **fix(#413-M11): \_scanSeenEdges not reset to null on scan exception** — `_scanSeenEdges` is now reset to null in the `finally` block of `scanProject` alongside `exitScan()`, preventing state leakage across scans
- **fix(#413-L1): redundant removeEdgesForFile calls in incremental scan** — removed duplicate `removeEdgesForFile` call for changed files (was called once in changedFiles loop and again in dependentFiles loop)
- **fix(#413-L2): same Parser instance shared between javascript and typescript keys** — TypeScript grammar fallback now creates a separate Parser instance instead of storing the same object under both keys
- **fix(#413-L3): hardcoded magic numbers in \_extractStandardSymbols** — extracted `MAX_NAME_NODES` and `MAX_MATCHING_DEFS` named constants (5000 each) from the method body
- **fix(#413-L7): params.project = project mutates caller's params object** — factory now uses spread operator to create a new params object (`effectiveParams`) instead of mutating the caller's object
- **fix(#413-L8): LspClient cmd! non-null assertion on command array** — added explicit validation that the command array has at least one element; logs error and triggers cleanup if empty

### Housekeeping

- **fix(#413-L4): dead symlink cycle detection code removed** — cleaned up dead code that tracked symlink paths instead of real target paths
- **fix(#413-L5): trivial getProjectGraph wrapper removed** — eliminated the no-value wrapper that just called `scanProject()` unconditionally (caching is already inside scanProject)
- **fix(#413-L6): dead ternary — condition always true** — removed redundant ternary inside an already-guarded `if (realStat.isDirectory())` block

## [0.17.0] - 2026-06-23

### Security

- **fix(#394): safety.ts git commit early-return bypasses ALL destructive command checks** — removed the `isGitCommit` early return in `detectDestructiveCommand` that allowed commands like `git commit -m x && rm -rf /` to bypass all safety checks; the `--no-verify` handling is already covered by the pre-commit gate (Check 2)
- **fix(#395): MCP shazam_lookup path traversal** — added `validatePathInProject` checks in the MCP handler and as defense-in-depth in `_executeFileDetailAsync` and `executeLookupAsync`, closing the path-traversal hole where MCP clients could read arbitrary files outside the project root
- **fix(#402-P2-3): MCP rename bypasses safety gate + dryRun defaults to destructive** — MCP `shazam_rename_symbol` now defaults `dryRun` to `true` (matching Pi path) and enforces the `hasCallChainChecked` impact-check safety gate
- **fix(#402-P2-4): MCP entry allows PROJECT_ROOT "/"** — removed `realRoot === "/"` allowance; replaced `startsWith(homeDir)` with path separator boundary check to prevent prefix confusion

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#393): indefinite repeated verification reminder** — added `_reminderSent` flag to `verify-state.ts`; reminder is sent once per edit cycle and resets on new edit, verify call, or session reset
- **fix(#396): lsp_enrich CTS cancellation disconnected from client request** — added `externalToken` parameter to all 12 public LSP client methods; linked external token to internal CTS in `_sendRequest` so enrich-layer cancellation now propagates to the actual LSP request
- **fix(#397): setLspManager swaps manager before previous shutdown completes** — made `setLspManager` async, awaiting previous manager shutdown before swapping; MCP entry point now properly awaits
- **fix(#402-P2-1): runFormatterCommand swallows execFileSync failure** — `runFormatterCommand` now rethrows on formatter failure so `runFormatters` pushes `[FAIL]` instead of `[OK]`
- **fix(#402-P2-2): hand-built file:// URI instead of pathToUri** — replaced `file://${filePath}` with `pathToUri(filePath)` in type-hierarchy request for correct URI encoding

### Performance

- **fix(#398): scanner.ts O(N\*M) imports.includes on incremental scan hot path** — built `fileImportedBy: Map<string, Set<string>>` reverse import index for O(1) dependent lookup; incremental scan no longer scans every file's import list
- **fix(#399): lookup.ts constructs new TreeSitterAdapter per \_extractDocstring call** — replaced per-call `new TreeSitterAdapter()` with module-scoped lazy singleton; hover batch of 20 symbols no longer triggers 20 full grammar loads
- **fix(#402-P3-1): sequential await of independent supertypes/subtypes** — changed to `Promise.all` for parallel type hierarchy requests
- **fix(#402-P3-2): sequential await + readFileSync in crash re-open loop** — changed to async file reads with `Promise.allSettled` for didOpen calls
- **fix(#402-P3-3): Array.includes on BFS hot path** — converted `files` to `Set<string>` for O(1) lookup in impact analysis
- **fix(#402-P3-5): sync readFileSync in format scan loops** — changed `detectIndentationStyle` and `scanFormatIssues` to async concurrent file reads

### Refactoring

- **fix(#400): pi-extension.d.ts stub gaps force as-unknown-as casts** — added `input?: unknown` and `toolCallId?: string` to `ToolCallEventBase`; removed 9 `as unknown as` double-casts across hooks and tools; added `isLocationLinkArray` type guard in `lsp_enrich.ts`
- **fix(#401): decorative Unicode in 48 source files** — replaced 272 occurrences of em-dash (U+2014) and arrow (U+2192) with ASCII equivalents (`--`/`-` and `->`) across all non-test source files and tool output

### Housekeeping

- **fix(#402-P3-4): silent 100-file cap without truncation flag** — `scanFormatIssues` now emits `... and N more files not scanned` when `files.length > 100`

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-23

### Security

- **fix(#380): shazam_lookup path traversal guard** — user-supplied `name`/`file` params now validated with `validatePathInProject` before reaching `statSync` or LSP `didOpen`/`readFileAdaptiveAsync`; `LspManager.getServerForFile` adds projectRoot prefix check as defense-in-depth

- **fix(#383): safety hook RCE blocklist expansion** — 7 new HIGH_RISK_PATTERNS: `eval`, `source`/`.`, `curl|sh`, `wget|bash`, `base64|sh`, backtick substitution, process substitution `<(...)`; prevents prompt-injected arbitrary code execution bypassing the confirmation dialog

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#381): LSP CTS cancellation not wired (#376 regression)** — `withEnrichTimeout` now accepts optional `CancellationTokenSource`; on timeout, `cts.cancel()` fires so the underlying LSP request frees server resources. All 7 callers create and dispose a CTS.
- **fix(#381): ensureFileOpened crash-recovery gap** — `ensureFileOpened` now calls `ctx.trackOpenedFile(language, filePath)` after didOpen, so files opened via lookup/hover/rename survive LSP crash recovery
- **fix(#381): initialize connection! race** — `initialize()` caches `this.connection` into a local `conn` variable before the `await`, eliminating the non-null assertion race with `_cleanupAfterCrash`
- **fix(#382): collectDiagnostics O(N^2) performance** — `_notifications` changed from array to `Map<string, PublishDiagnosticsParams>`; notification arrival uses `.set()` (O(1) upsert); `collectDiagnostics` iterates Map entries instead of reverse-loop with unshift
- **fix(#384): rename_symbol non-atomic write** — `writeFileSync` replaced with `atomicWriteFile` (tmp+rename) for both write and rollback paths, preventing source corruption on SIGKILL/OOM
- **fix(#384): rename_symbol hardcoded scanProject root** — `scanProject(".")` now uses `params.project || process.cwd()`; `validatePathInProject` passes consistent projectRoot
- **fix(#385): Tree interface missing delete()** — `Tree` interface adds `delete?(): void`, removing `as any` cast in `lookup.ts` and `as unknown as` cast in `scanner.ts`

### Housekeeping

- **fix(#386): Chinese comments translated to English** — 16 source files translated to comply with LANGUAGE RULE (English-only hard requirement); `types/pi-extension.d.ts` preserved as upstream stubs
- **fix(#387): silent catch blocks eliminated** — 28 catch blocks across 14 files now log with `console.warn` before returning fallback; 3 `.catch(() => {})` replaced with logged catch; decorative `└` (U+2514) in tool output replaced with ASCII `-`
- **fix(#388): P3 cleanup** — decorative Unicode `─`/`→` in comments replaced with ASCII `-`/`->`; go.mod filter over-exclusion fixed; dead `validatePathInProject` check removed; `Array.includes` -> `Set.has` for O(1) dedup in impact.ts; `setTimeout` in manager shutdown now cleared; `!!!`/`!` replaced with `[HIGH]`/`[MED]` in safety.ts; 4 new secret patterns added to redact.ts (GitLab PAT, Google API key, SendGrid API key, Twilio API key)

## [0.15.3] - 2026-06-22

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#376): security hardening, LSP resource management, and error handling** (#377)
  - **Security**: PATH scanning restricted to trusted system directories (`SAFE_PATH_DIRS`) — prevents command injection via manipulated `PATH` environment variable; PROJECT_ROOT validated to be within user home directory with symlink escape detection; `_factory.ts` `validatePathInProject` hardened with realpath traversal check
  - **LSP lifecycle**: `_doClose` race condition fixed (check exitCode before removing listeners); `_docVersions` cleared on cleanup to prevent stale state accumulation; old LSP client properly closed before language re-initialization; `proc.kill()` guarded against already-exited processes; `withTimeout` CTS cancel guard added
  - **Error handling**: 25+ empty catch blocks replaced with `console.warn` diagnostics across `core/`, `lsp/`, `hooks/`, `mcp/`, `tools/` — every error branch now either handles (with a log) or propagates
  - **Safety hook**: `--no-verify` detection fixed to handle combined short flags like `-nq`, `-qn` (previously only matched standalone `-n`)
  - **LSP diagnostics polling**: replaced fixed 500ms wait with adaptive polling (5 attempts × 200ms, stops early when diagnostics arrive) — prevents stale/empty diagnostic results on slower LSP servers
  - **LSP enrichment**: simplified `withEnrichTimeout` — removed duplicate CTS cancel logic (already handled by `_sendRequest`)

- **fix(#378): CTS timing and SAFE_PATH_DIRS expansion** (#379)
  - `_sendRequest` CTS dispose timing fixed: CTS was disposed synchronously before the returned Promise settled, causing premature CancellationToken cleanup; now uses proper async disposal pattern
  - `SAFE_PATH_DIRS` expanded to include `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/snap/bin` — Homebrew (macOS) and snap (Linux) users can now auto-detect LSP servers installed via these package managers

### Housekeeping

- **chore(#378): Prettier formatting** — `core/git-hooks.ts`, `tools/verify.ts`, `hooks/safety.ts` had code style drift; reformatted to match project Prettier config

### Documentation

- **docs(#378): agent checklist expansion** — added user rule anchors (address as 老板, completion report format, code comment conventions, no empty catch blocks) to AGENTS.md checklist
- **docs(#378): Kimi Code hooks sync** — updated `docs/kimi-code-hooks.md` version mapping for v0.15.3 tool name consolidation sync across all Kimi Code shell hooks

## [0.15.2] - 2026-06-22

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#362): Dart LSP server never activated** — `_detectLanguage()` was missing `.dart` mapping, causing the Dart language server (configured in `lsp/servers.ts`) to never be used for `.dart` files. Dart/Flutter projects now get full LSP diagnostics, hover, and type hierarchy support.

### Documentation

- **docs(#362): full documentation audit** — synced language counts (6→7 for tree-sitter+LSP across README, SKILL, mcp/README, INSTRUCTION), added missing files to architecture trees (`changes.ts`, `definitions.ts`, `git-utils.ts`), updated hook mapping tables (`issue-guard.ts`, `agent-context-guard.ts`), fixed OPS.md checklist references, added `types/*.d.ts` to prettier paths, corrected tool count in package.json (14→9)
- **docs(#362): AGENTS.md version sync** — updated version reference from v0.14.2 to current

## [0.15.1] - 2026-06-22

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#362): JSON envelope command names after tool consolidation** — `shazam_impact` flat mode JSON now uses correct envelope (`shazam_impact` instead of bare JSON); `shazam_overview` hotspots JSON envelope uses `shazam_overview` instead of old `shazam_hotspots`
- **fix(#362): mutually exclusive `--files`/`--symbol` in impact** — passing both now returns a clear error instead of silently dropping `--files`
- **fix(#362): empty files array in impact** — `--files []` now returns an error instead of showing misleading empty results
- **fix(#362): MCP impact depth unclamped** — MCP handler for `shazam_impact` now clamps depth to [1,10] matching Pi tool behavior
- **fix(#362): MCP lookup no file path detection** — `shazam_lookup` MCP handler now detects file paths and dispatches to file detail
- **fix(#362): MCP impact missing error for no params** — returns clear error when neither `--symbol` nor `--files` is passed
- **fix(#362): MCP changes missing JSON support** — `shazam_changes` MCP handler now supports `{ json: true }`
- **fix(#362): GBK encoding crash in hover/type hierarchy** — `_getHoverInfo` and `_getTypeHierarchy` now use `readFileAdaptive` (UTF-8 → GBK → GB2312 fallback) instead of hardcoded `readFileSync("utf-8")`
- **fix(#362): duplicate deps section titles** — Python/Rust/Go dependency sections now use language-specific titles (`### Key Python/Rust/Go Dependencies`)
- **fix(#362): verify text mode missing verdict** — `shazam_verify` text output now shows `### Verdict: PASS/WARN/FAIL` (including lspOnly mode)
- **fix(#362): PageRank decimal inconsistency** — all PageRank values now use `.toFixed(4)` across overview, lookup, and hotspots output
- **fix(#362): `executeCallChainJson` missing rename state record** — now calls `recordCallChain()` matching `executeCallChain` behavior
- **fix(#362): MCP entry hardcoded version** — version now reads from `package.json` at startup, preventing stale version display
- **fix(#362): MCP entry double shutdown** — added reentrancy guard to prevent `transport.onclose` and `stdin.end` from triggering overlapping LSP shutdown

### Performance

- **perf(#362): parallel hover lookups** — `shazam_lookup` now fetches hover info for all symbol matches concurrently via `Promise.all` instead of serial `for...of` + `await`
- **perf(#362): reuse fileStats in overview** — `_computeHotspots` now accepts precomputed `fileStats` from `_buildOverviewText`, avoiding duplicate graph traversal

### Robustness

- **robust(#362): split TypeHierarchy error handling** — LSP `prepareTypeHierarchy`, `typeHierarchy/supertypes`, and `typeHierarchy/subtypes` now have independent try/catch blocks so partial results are preserved when one request fails
- **robust(#362): use lsp_enrich layer for hover** — `_getHoverInfo` now uses `ensureFileOpened` from shared LSP infrastructure instead of manual `didOpen`, benefiting from mtime tracking and proper timeout handling

### Documentation

- **docs(#362): expanded file path detection** — `_isFilePath` regex now recognizes `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.less`, `.sh`, `.bash`, `.toml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.md`
- **docs(#362): improved error messages** — filter empty result suggests removing `--filter`; symbol not found suggests `shazam_overview`; compact mode output now includes count header

### Housekeeping

- **chore(#362): remove dead code** — `_extractContextLines` (unused return value), `contextLines` field from `HoverInfo`, and stale `describe.skip` test blocks referencing deleted module files

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-22

### Refactoring

- **refactor(#362): Tool consolidation 14->9 -- unified lookup, impact+call_chain, overview+hotspots**
  - Merged `shazam_symbol`, `shazam_file_detail`, `shazam_hover`, `shazam_type_hierarchy` into `shazam_lookup` (auto-detects file path vs symbol name)
  - Merged `shazam_call_chain` into `shazam_impact` (new `--symbol` parameter for per-symbol tracing)
  - Merged `shazam_hotspots` into `shazam_overview` (hotspots section shown at end of overview)
  - Renamed `shazam_fix` to `shazam_format` (precise naming, avoids LLM confusion)
  - Added `shazam_changes` -- lightweight git change summary with risk level
  - Deleted `shazam_codesearch` (overlaps with ffgrep)
  - Updated all hooks, MCP tools, NEXT_RULES, and definitions to match new tool names

### Breaking Changes

- Tool count reduced from 14 to 9. LLM agents using old tool names (`shazam_symbol`, `shazam_file_detail`, `shazam_hover`, `shazam_type_hierarchy`, `shazam_call_chain`, `shazam_hotspots`, `shazam_codesearch`, `shazam_fix`) must update to new names.
- `shazam_impact --files` parameter is now optional when using `--symbol` mode.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-06-22

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#355): systemPrompt character explosion** — `event.systemPrompt` is `string` at runtime but code treated it as `string[]`, causing `[...spread]` to explode each character onto its own line and inflate the system prompt from 3K to 102K tokens. Now uses `Array.isArray()` to handle both types safely. External report by @finnvyrn.
- **fix(#354): defensive graph.symbols check** — `rename_symbol` now validates `graph?.symbols` before use to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" crashes in edge cases.

### Features & Enhancements

- **enhance(#353): error-type-specific failure recovery** — `hooks/failure-recovery.ts` now parses error messages to provide targeted suggestions: file-not-found (suggests `shazam_file_detail`), permission-denied, network errors, module-not-found. Added `analyzeError()` and `extractErrorText()` helper functions.

### Documentation

- **docs(OPS.md)**: add Phase 7 Kimi Code Hooks Sync checklist. Renumber Phase 7 Self-Improvement to Phase 8.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-06-21

### Features & Enhancements

- **feat: Language availability awareness** — `core/treesitter.ts` now tracks parser load status per language. `tools/overview.ts` and `hooks/before-start.ts` inject parser availability warnings into LLM context when a project uses languages whose tree-sitter grammar failed to load. Prevents "silent failures" where graph-based tools return empty for valid files.
- **refactor: Contextual parser warnings** — `getProjectParserWarnings(filePaths)` only alerts for languages the project actually uses. Pure TypeScript projects never see Dart warnings. Mixed projects only see warnings for their own unavailable languages.

### Bug Fixes

- **fix: release.sh automation** — Auto-extract CHANGELOG.md section for GitHub Release notes (replaces placeholder "See CHANGELOG for details"). Auto-delete merged remote temporary branches (Step 8.5). Added Dart to overview language list.

### Documentation

- **docs(OPS.md)**: Phase 7 Self-Improvement Retrospective — companion file audit table + process retrospective checklist. Rule: fix OPS.md gaps in the same release.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-21

### Features & Enhancements

- **feat(#349): Add Dart (Flutter) language support** — `.dart` extension mapping, `@sengac/tree-sitter-dart` grammar, Dart tree-sitter queries (function/class/import/call), Dart LSP server config (`dart language-server`), 12s LSP timeout. Tree-sitter grammar requires >=0.24 (graceful fallback with 0.22.4); LSP fully functional.

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#350): Graceful handling of non-git directories** — Extension no longer crashes or pollutes UI when working directory is not a git repository. Added `core/git-utils.ts` with `isGitRepo()`, `isProjectDir()`, `safeGitExec()`. Non-project dirs (no git, no marker files) skip scanProject. Git stderr suppressed on all calls. Per-process git availability cache.

### Documentation

- **docs: README.md** — Add "100% Vibe Coding" badge (built with Pi + DeepSeek-V4-Pro). Update language count 6→7.
- **docs: AGENTS.md** — Add §9 Open Source Issue Reply Guidelines for third-party contributors. Update architecture tree (add `core/git-utils.ts`). Update language count.
- **docs: OPS.md** — Add §1.0 General .md Sync Check step.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-06-21

### Other

- **chore(#348): Bump actions/checkout from 6.0.3 to 7.0.0** — Dependabot CI workflow dependency update.
- **chore: Apply Prettier formatting** — Consistent code style across 22 source files.
- **docs: Enhance LOCAL_CI.md** — Add format check, hook verification, contract check, MCP smoke test, and Pi integration smoke test steps (13 total).
- **docs: Add OPS.md** — Release operations checklist with 17 items covering documentation sync, version bump, CI, GitHub Release, post-release verification, and cleanup.
- **docs: Update AGENTS.md** — Add OPS.md reference and expand LOCAL_CI.md description with step summary.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-06-17

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#334): LspManager.\_shuttingDown is a one-way latch** — Reset \_shuttingDown in initializeAll() so LSP recovers after shutdown. Add 8s timeout to per-server close() in shutdown() to prevent hung-process leak.
- **fix(#335): UTF-8 boundary corruption in encoding.ts** — isValidUtf8 now treats truncated multi-byte sequences at 64KB chunk boundary as inconclusive instead of false, preventing misclassification as GBK/GB2312.
- **fix(#330): MCP shazam_verify runs sync path** — Switch to async verify (executeVerifyTextAsync/executeVerifyJsonAsync), enabling LSP diagnostics for MCP clients.
- **fix(#331): MCP silently ignores {json:true}** — Add maxTokens and json to all 14 Zod schemas; add topN bounds (min 1, max 50) to codesearch/hotspots.
- **fix(#336): codesearch hardcodes divergent skipDirs** — Replace local skipDirs sets with canonical SKIP_DIRS from core/filter.ts.

### Refactoring

- **refactor(#337): Extract core/redact.ts** — Shared SECRET_PATTERNS + redact() from mcp/tools.ts and hooks/tool-logger.ts.
- **refactor(#339): Extract core/formatters.ts** — Shared detectFormatters() from tools/fix.ts and hooks/shazam-guide.ts.
- **refactor(#340): Extract core/audit-log.ts** — Unified audit-log rotation (10MB size, 5 archived copies, 30-day age).
- **refactor(#338): Split oversized functions** — Extract helpers in tools/overview.ts (\_buildOverviewText), core/scanner.ts (\_walkDirectory), lsp/manager.ts (\_initServerForLanguage).

### Other

- **fix(#333): Batch cleanup** — Project root fixes, safety regex for combined flags, verify-state WARN handling, tree-sitter memory leak, logging improvements, documentation updates.
- **fix(#332): Definitions parity test** — Add definitions-parity.test.ts verifying TypeBox↔Zod field parity across all 14 tools.
- **fix(#341): AbortSignal not wired through** — Thread AbortSignal through initializeAll → getServerForLanguage → client.initialize. Parallelize runLspDiagnostics with Promise.allSettled.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-17

### Features & Enhancements

- **enhance(#327): P1 correctness batch** (#328)
  - **core/scanner**: use `statSync` (follows symlinks) instead of `lstatSync`; add symlink cycle detection via visited-realpath set
  - **core/filter**: allowlist `.github/.husky/.vscode/.claude` in `isTrackableEditedPath`
  - **tools/codesearch**: `builtinRegexSearch` now performs real regex matching with graceful literal fallback
  - **tools/overview**: use `params.project` instead of hardcoded `"."` for project root
  - **tools/definitions**: add TypeBox bounds on `depth` (1-10) and `topN` (1-50); clamp at runtime as defense-in-depth
  - **tools/fix**: validate `file` parameter does not escape project root
  - **tools/verify**: replace `execAsync(command)` with `execFileAsync(program, args)` to remove shell injection surface
  - **lsp/client**: null-check connection in `_sendRequest`, dispose `CancellationTokenSource`, track `_openedFiles` in `didClose`, remove dead `MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_URI`
  - **mcp/entry**: `await shutdown()` before `process.exit(0)` in SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers
  - **hooks/issue-guard**: scope `isError` trigger to bash + `gh`/`npm test` only

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#326): rename_symbol safety gate no longer blocks after preview** (#329)
  - Added `hooks/rename-state.ts` — session-scoped set of symbols reviewed via `shazam_call_chain`
  - `tools/call_chain.ts` records reviewed symbols on successful execution
  - `tools/rename_symbol.ts` gates `dryRun=false` on `hasCallChainChecked(symbol)` — infinite preview loop eliminated

### Refactoring

- **refactor(#324): shared bash command tokenizer** (#328)
  - New `hooks/_bash-utils.ts` with `tokenizeCommand` (now handles bash `'\''` escape) and `extractCommandFromEvent`
  - Deleted duplicate implementations in `hooks/safety.ts` and `hooks/issue-guard.ts`
  - 12 unit tests covering edge cases
- **refactor(#325): shared impact BFS** (#329)
  - Extracted `computeImpactBfs()` in `tools/impact.ts`; `graph.incoming` / `graph.outgoing` now appear exactly once
  - Text and JSON formatters share traversal output; fixed latent negative `affectedFileCount` bug
- **refactor(#327): dead-code cleanup** (#328)
  - Deleted unused exports from `core/{baseline,encoding,cache}` and dead `executeCheck`/`executeReady` from `tools/verify.ts`
  - `tools/rename_symbol.ts`: log rollback failures instead of swallowing
  - `lsp/manager.ts`: removed dead assignment
  - `mcp/tools.ts`: added inline `redact()` with secret patterns for audit log
  - Simplified `[rRfF]` regex to `[rf]` in `hooks/safety.ts` (input already lowercased)

### Other

- **docs**: AGENTS.md hooks tree synced with `hooks/_bash-utils.ts` and `hooks/rename-state.ts`
- **kimi-code plugin**: updated `mcp-reference.sh` CORE RULES to require `shazam_call_chain` before `shazam_rename_symbol`

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-15

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#319): core/lsp/mcp reliability** — per-URI LSP doc version, atomic cache rename with Windows fallback, scanner edge dedup and symlink handling, MCP graceful shutdown, LSP manager restart backoff with exponential delay, YAML rootMarkers fix
- **fix(#320): tool/hook safety** — write-tool dryRun defaults to true, audit log secret redaction with rotation, hook state race fixes (verify fail-closed, pre-edit timer cleanup, stop-verify flag), argv-based command detection for safety/issue-guard

### Changed

- **chore(#321): docs and schema parity** — language counts unified across README/SKILL/AGENTS (6 languages), TypeBox defaults mirror Zod, emoji removed from all source, Chinese comments translated to English, dependency versions pinned, verify→fix Next rule added

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-15

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#309): core/ robustness — atomic cache write, husky detection** (#317)
  - **cache**: `saveGraphCache` now writes to `.tmp` file first, then uses `renameSync` for atomic cache updates. Process crash mid-write no longer corrupts the cache.
  - **git-hooks**: `installPreCommitHook` now detects `.husky/` directory and `lefthook.yml`/`lefthook.yaml` before overwriting. Throws with user-friendly instructions when a hook manager is detected.

- **fix(#310): LSP reliability — request cancellation, async reads, adaptive timeout** (#318)
  - **lsp/client**: Added `CancellationTokenSource` for all LSP requests. On timeout, sends `$/cancelRequest` to the server. Replaced all 15 `withTimeout(sendRequest(...))` patterns with `_sendRequest(...)` helper.
  - **core/encoding**: Added `readFileAdaptiveAsync()` using `fs.promises.readFile` and `fs.promises.stat`. Same encoding fallback logic (UTF-8 → GBK → GB2312).
  - **tools/lsp_enrich**: `ensureFileOpened()` now uses async file reading. Added adaptive timeout: 10s for first request per file, 5s for subsequent.

### Skipped Findings (False Positives Verified)

- **#9 PageRank dangling mass**: Already redistributes dangling node mass uniformly
- **#8 PageRank convergence**: Already has parameterized `maxIter=50` and `tol=1e-6` with early-break
- **#19 LSP server command path**: Already has 3-tier search (project-local, PATH, user home)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-15

### Features & Enhancements

- **enhance(#311): tools/ safety and usability improvements** (#314)
  - **rename_symbol**: Added backup-before-write rollback mechanism — if any file write fails during rename, all already-written files are rolled back to their backup content (atomic operation)
  - **impact**: Replaced single-hop edge traversal with BFS + `--depth` parameter (default 3). Deep call chains (A→B→C→D) now correctly surface all affected files
  - **call_chain**: Added `MAX_DISPLAY_REFS = 50` automatic output truncation to prevent token explosion on heavily-referenced symbols
  - **safe_delete**: Added dynamic reference warning when zero static refs found — warns about eval(), dynamic import(), Reflect API limitations

- **enhance(#313): CI and test coverage improvements** (#316)
  - Added 26 MCP integration tests covering full scan → analyze → format pipeline using project codebase as fixture
  - Added 11 performance benchmark tests with synthetic project generation and time budgets (scanProject, PageRank, codesearch)
  - Added `integration` and `benchmark` CI jobs with appropriate timeouts

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#312): hooks/ and entry layer fixes** (#315)
  - **before-start**: Added file count pre-check (>5000 source files → skip sync scan, return placeholder). Prevents 5-10s agent startup blocking on large projects
  - **safety**: Replaced `lower.includes()` substring matching with regex + whitespace normalization. Now catches `rm  -rf` (extra spaces), `rm -r -f` (split flags), `rm\t-rf` (tabs)
  - **shazam-guide**: Switched all 5 `execFileSync` calls to async `promisify(execFile)`. Function was declared `async` but used sync execution — now truly async
  - **index**: Added `lspManager.shutdown()` on LSP initialization timeout to clean up orphaned language server processes

### Skipped Findings (False Positives Verified)

- **#25 verify concurrency lock**: Node.js is single-threaded, no CPU contention risk from concurrent async calls
- **#48 MCP parameter validation**: Zod schemas in `definitions.ts` already validate via MCP SDK `inputSchema`
- **#27 ripgrep availability**: `codesearch.ts` already has `findRipgrep()` with fallback to builtin JS search

## [0.10.4] - 2026-06-14

### Security Fixes

- **fix(#286): command injection via file path in shazam-guide.ts** (#287)
  - Replaced `execSync` with `execFileSync` for all 5 formatter calls (ruff, prettier, biome, gofmt, rustfmt)
  - Prevents shell injection via malicious file paths
- **fix(#286): shell: true in tools/fix.ts formatter execution** (#287)
  - Removed `shell: true` from `execFileSync` to prevent metacharacter interpretation

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#284): incremental scan produces incorrect graph** (#287)
  - Bug #1: `fileImports` now stores resolved file paths instead of raw module specifiers
  - Bug #2: Cross-file call-edge tracing now uses snapshot of incoming edges before `removeFileData`
  - Bug #3: Dependent file edges are cleared before rebuild to prevent duplicate accumulation
  - Bug #4: Incoming entries on targets are cleaned before deleting outgoing edges
- **fix(#285): MCP stale graph never refreshed** (#288)

## [0.10.3] - 2026-06-14

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#276): unify executeReady and executeReadyJson isReady logic** (#283)
  - `tools/verify.ts`: `executeReadyJson` now uses `internalOrphanCount` instead of `orphanCount` for readiness check, matching `executeReady` behavior
  - Previously, exported orphan symbols caused inconsistent READY/NOT READY results between the two functions

- **fix(#277): use nameIndex for O(1) symbol lookup** (#283)
  - `tools/symbol.ts`: `findSymbols()` now uses `graph.nameIndex.get(name)` instead of linear scan over all symbols
  - `tools/call_chain.ts`: `findSymbolsByName()` same optimization
  - Significant performance improvement for projects with large symbol counts

### Documentation

- Added Claude Code hooks reference guide (`docs/claude-code-hooks.md`)

## [0.10.2] - 2026-06-14

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#262): move interface/type_alias orphan skip to before incoming check** (#274)
  - `core/filter.ts`: moved interface/type_alias skip to before the incoming reference check (unconditional)
  - Previous fix was inside the zero-incoming-refs block, which was never reached because interfaces get import edges

## [0.10.1] - 2026-06-14

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#264,#266): commit gate checks verify PASS/FAIL and gives clear instructions** (#268)
  - `hooks/verify-state.ts`: added verdict tracking (PASS/FAIL) to `markVerifyCalled()`, new `hasRecentPassingVerify()` function
  - `hooks/stop-verify.ts`: extracts text from verify result content blocks for verdict parsing
  - `hooks/safety.ts`: pre-commit gate now uses `hasRecentPassingVerify()` with detailed rejection message

- **fix(#265): assessRisk uses orphan delta instead of absolute count** (#269)
  - `tools/verify.ts`: `assessRisk()` now computes orphan delta from session baseline via `diffFromBaseline()`
  - Uses `newOrphanCount` for threshold checks instead of `internalOrphans.length`
  - Falls back to absolute count when no session baseline exists

- **fix(#260,#261): exclude vendor/minified files from impact blast radius and hotspots** (#273)
  - `core/filter.ts`: added patterns for `vendor/`, `*.min.*`, `*.generated.*`, `*.bundle.*` to `NON_SOURCE_FILE_PATTERNS`
  - `tools/impact.ts`: filters `affectedFiles` with `isNonSourceFile()` in both `executeImpact()` and `executeImpactJson()`

- **fix(#267): add --direction parameter to call_chain** (#270)
  - `tools/call_chain.ts`: added `direction` parameter (`incoming`|`outgoing`|`both`, default `both`)
  - `tools/definitions.ts`, `mcp/tools.ts`: updated schemas and MCP handler

- **fix(#263): add smart tokenization fallback for natural language codesearch queries** (#272)
  - `tools/codesearch.ts`: added `mode` parameter (`literal`|`regex`|`smart`)
  - When literal search returns < 3 results and query looks like natural language, auto-falls back to tokenized regex search
  - `tools/definitions.ts`, `mcp/tools.ts`: updated schemas

- **fix(#262): exclude TypeScript interfaces and type aliases from orphan detection** (#271)
  - `core/filter.ts`: `findOrphans()` now skips `interface` and `type_alias` symbols (pure type-level, no runtime callers)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-14

### Features & Enhancements

- **feat(#253): add issue-guard hook** (#257)
  - New `hooks/issue-guard.ts`: detects `gh issue create` in bash commands, classifies severity (serious vs trivial), sets pending impact flag
  - New `hooks/impact-state.ts`: shared state module for impact tracking (set/clear/has/reset)

- **feat(#254): upgrade pre-edit.ts to block edits when impact is pending** (#257)
  - Modified `hooks/pre-edit.ts`: blocks `write`/`edit` tool calls when pending impact exists
  - Issue created -> edit blocked -> shazam_impact run -> edit allowed

- **feat(#255): add agent-context-guard hook** (#257)
  - New `hooks/agent-context-guard.ts`: intercepts agent-like tool calls (agent, agent_swarm, subagent)
  - Review/audit tasks with insufficient structural context are blocked
  - Coding tasks with insufficient context get a non-blocking warning
  - Short prompts (< 30 words) are skipped

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#251): shazam_codesearch target="code" returns empty results** (#256)
  - Added `projectRoot` parameter to `executeFulltextSearch()`, passed to ripgrep as search directory
  - Added `-F` flag to ripgrep for literal string matching (no regex interpretation)
  - Moved `scanProject(".")` inside the symbol-search branch to avoid unnecessary scanning
  - Forwarded `projectRoot` from MCP `tools.ts` to `executeFulltextSearch`

- **fix(#252): shazam_verify returns 529 false positive orphan symbols for Rust** (#256)
  - Added Rust `pub` visibility detection in `_isExported` (walks AST children for `visibility_modifier` nodes)
  - Added 30 Rust standard trait names to entry point filter (From, Into, Clone, Debug, Serialize, etc.)
  - Added Rust framework function patterns to `isFrameworkHandler` (new, run, serve, from_request, etc.)
  - Skip `impl` block symbols from orphan detection (structural declarations, never called by name)

### Tests

- Added 26 new tests: full-text search with projectRoot, Rust orphan detection, impact state, issue guard, agent context guard. Full suite: 301 passed.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-06-13

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#246): findOrphans namespace-import regression** (#250)
  - Refined side-effect skip from v0.9.4 to apply only when the importer has NO binding targeting the file. Unused internal symbols in `import * as Utils from './utils'` modules are now correctly reported.
  - Added `resolveModulePath` / `moduleMatchesFile` helpers mirroring `core/scanner.ts` `resolveImport` for specifier-to-file matching.

- **fix(#248): findOrphans Python `__all__` symbols reported as orphans** (#250)
  - Added `extractPythonAllNames` in `core/scanner.ts`. After symbol extraction for Python files, scans for top-level `__all__ = [...]` and flips listed symbols to `visibility=exported`.
  - Handles direct lists and `["a"] + ["b"]` concatenation.

- **fix(#249): findOrphans React PascalCase components in .tsx/.jsx** (#250)
  - PascalCase functions/classes in `.tsx` / `.jsx` files are now skipped (consumed via JSX, no symbol-level ref in the graph).
  - Decorator detection and DI reflection deferred (require tree-sitter parent-chain walking / LSP semantic tokens).

### Not Fixed (Documented)

- **#247**: CJS `module.exports = fn` detection deferred — requires extending tree-sitter query patterns; CJS is increasingly rare in modern ESM projects.

### Tests

- Added 3 new tests (namespace import, Python `__all__`, PascalCase React). Full suite: 274 passed (was 271).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-13

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#243,#244): findOrphans skips side-effect modules and .d.ts ambient files** (#245)
  - Side-effect modules: symbols in files that appear in any other file's `fileImports` list are now excluded from orphan detection. A `import './polyfill'` creates only a file-level edge, no symbol bindings — previously all of the file's internal symbols were falsely reported as orphans.
  - `.d.ts` files: all symbols in ambient declaration files are now excluded. Tree-sitter emits them as regular `interface` / `function` / `type` with `visibility=public`, but their consumers are via global scope or type-only imports — invisible to symbol-level static analysis.

### Tests

- Added 3 new tests (side-effect skip, negative case, .d.ts skip). Full suite: 271 passed (was 268).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-13

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#241): pre-commit gate shows interactive popup, orphan false positives, bash CWD mismatch, non-project edit tracking** (#242)
  - `hooks/safety.ts`: replaced `ctx.ui.select()` popup with direct auto-block for git commit without recent `shazam_verify`. Works in non-interactive (print/RPC) modes. `--no-verify` still bypasses.
  - `core/filter.ts` `findOrphans`: skip ALL exported symbols from orphan detection (consumers are external to the scanned graph). Previously only high-PageRank exports were skipped, inflating orphan counts with exported types/interfaces.
  - `hooks/before-start.ts`: use `ctx.cwd` instead of hardcoded `"."` so `generateOverviewForPrompt` scans Pi's detected project directory, not the parent.
  - `index.ts`: capture `ctx.cwd` in `before_agent_start` and update module-level `projectRoot` when it differs from `process.cwd()`.
  - `lsp/manager.ts`: added `setProjectRoot()` method for post-construction root updates.
  - `hooks/pre-edit.ts`: filter tracked paths through new `isTrackableEditedPath()` so writes to `/tmp`, `~/.pi`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, and other dot-directories do not trigger spurious verify reminders.
  - `core/filter.ts` `NON_SOURCE_FILE_PATTERNS`: tightened regexes to catch `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `target/` at path start.
  - Removed dead `isRegistrationFile` helper.

### Tests

- Added 25 new tests across 5 files (filter, safety, trackable-path, pre-edit-integration, lsp-manager-root). Full suite: 268 passed (was 243).

  - `createBaseline()` immediately reassigns both `_baseline` and `_previousOrphans`

- **refactor(#233): remove unnecessary optional chaining where types guarantee presence** (#234)
  - `ctx.ui.notify()` and `ctx.ui.confirm()` — both `ui` and methods are non-optional on their types

  - Replaced `defCap.includes("export")` with AST ancestor traversal (`_isExported` helper)
  - Checks if any ancestor node type includes "export" (e.g., `export_statement`)
  - Exported TS/JS functions, classes, and interfaces now correctly marked as `visibility: "exported"`
  - Fixes orphan detection filters that rely on `sym.visibility === "exported"`
