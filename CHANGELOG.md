## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-08

### Features & Enhancements

- **enhance(#199): shazam_impact output now includes symbol-level detail, test discovery, and risk assessment** (#207)
  - Added risk assessment based on affected file and symbol counts (low/medium/high)
  - Added symbol grouping by file with upstream/downstream direction
  - Added automatic test discovery for target files using `shazam_find_tests`
  - Enhanced output format with better structure and information density

### Bug Fixes

- **fix(#196,#200): shazam_find_tests sourceFile and module parameters now search project-root test directories** (#204)
  - Fixed `sourceFile` parameter to search `tests/`, `test/`, `__test__/` directories at project root
  - Fixed `module` parameter by including files with 0 symbols in graph (e.g., test files with no exports)
  - Both `--sourceFile core/scanner.ts` and `--module scanner` now correctly find `tests/scanner.test.ts`

- **fix(#198): shazam_verify orphan detection now distinguishes internal and exported symbols** (#206)
  - `findOrphans()` returns structured result with separate lists for internal and exported orphans
  - Risk assessment now only counts internal orphans (exported orphans are informational)
  - Output clearly separates "Internal (likely dead code)" and "Exported (may be used externally)"

### Refactoring

- **refactor(#197): reduce shazam-guide hook noise — remove redundant notifications** (#205)
  - Removed write/edit success notification (LLM already knows about `shazam_verify` from SKILL.md)
  - Removed search/grep/find notification (LLM already knows about `shazam_codesearch` from SKILL.md)
  - Removed `shazam_verify` PASS notification (LLM already sees the verify result)
  - Removed `shazam_file_detail` notification (not all files have tests)
  - Kept valuable notifications: symbol with 5+ callers, verify FAIL/WARN, multi-file edit, impact/rename safety reminders

- **refactor(#203): unify Pi and MCP tool definitions** (#208)
  - Created `tools/definitions.ts` with shared tool definitions (single source of truth)
  - Updated `mcp/tools.ts` to use shared definitions for descriptions and parameter schemas
  - Both Pi and MCP now use the same descriptions and parameter schemas

### Other

- **fix: use @latest for local installations to avoid version locking**
  - Changed `pi install npm:pi-shazam@0.5.5` to `pi install npm:pi-shazam@latest`
